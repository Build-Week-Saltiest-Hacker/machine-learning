49,isugimpy,23300049,"&gt; The amount of money you are saving by WFH full-time, assuming you properly leverage the opportunity (i.e. cooking own meals and multitasking chores), far outweighs any paltry notion that could be provided in recompense for you dutifully enshrining a guest bedroom as your employment zone.<p>This one&#x27;s really important.  Prior to moving to my current job, I had a 15-20 minute drive to work every day.  I was filling my car up with gas every 2 weeks like clockwork.  I was also going out for lunch semi-regularly.  Moving to WFH (before the pandemic, because this was a planned move for me) totally changed the math on a lot of stuff.  I haven&#x27;t filled my car up with gas since early February at this point, though even before social distancing the previous fillup was in early December.  My insurance cost on my car went down due to no commute.  Food costs went down because I was cooking when I wanted lunch.  These changes made a pretty noticeable improvement to our finances and we&#x27;re now getting ready to move into a house where I&#x27;ll have a dedicated office for work instead of a corner of the basement, and that&#x27;s going to have some nice tax impacts too.<p>My employer has done a really good job embracing remote.  There was a time when they actually retracted all ability to work remotely and had everyone move to work at our main office or look for another job.  A shift in regime happened, and remote eventually came back, and now we&#x27;ve got a whole pile of benefits specifically for our remote employees, to help counterbalance the fact that they don&#x27;t get some of the benefits that our in-office employees get.<p>One thing that we all get is a stipend we&#x27;re allowed to use generally on things that help improve our lives or help us grow as people (a few examples of expensible things would be a new mattress, cooking classes, voluntarily chosen equipment for our workspace, etc).  So we really already had the ability to expense the things we need for WFH, which has definitely been a big help.<p>As far as Overwatch between PRs...  I mean, let&#x27;s be real.  Think about how much time you spend in the office chatting with coworkers about weekend plans, or what was on TV last night, or any other thing.

What counts as standard of living or quality of life varies according to the individual.<p>For example, the bay area has excellent weather, a ton of ethnic&#x2F;cultural diversity, very solid restaurant scene, lots of interesting nature nearby to explore, the area around SF has passable public transit, some bits have decent biking&#x2F;walkability, and there&#x27;s excellent options for international travel.

I can&#x27;t be clearer on this, I consider it pointless, frustrating even, to discuss - it feels like arguing against a strawman - if you think that humans will simply stop mixing for years on end, viewing each other through a screen or far away enough that we can&#x27;t even smell each other, there are really only two explanations in my mind:<p>a) you have some atypical neurochemistry which means you don&#x27;t&#x2F;can&#x27;t understand human socialisation properly<p>and&#x2F;or<p>b) you&#x27;re locked inside with your family and so you can&#x27;t &quot;feel&quot; the dread that millions of people are feeling right now, wondering whether they&#x27;ll ever touch another human again<p>For me, it&#x27;s an urge almost as strong as the urge to drink water. If you refuse to take that on board and just pretend that people are being irrational because your brain doesn&#x27;t work that way, you&#x27;re going to remain confused by this.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to go to a language class, a theatre, a gallery, a pub, a cafe, sit on a bus, a train, a restaurant, go on a date, have children play in a playground, work in an office, and so on and so forth, for years, or you want to replace them with some wanky dystopian &quot;social distancing&quot; version in which you sit behind screens, wear masks, and have 10 people in a hall built for hundreds, that&#x27;s cool, you do you. I&#x27;ll do it for a few months, I won&#x27;t do it for years, because that represents the imposition of a &gt;2% mortality rate on me anyway by removing all of the good parts of life. My response to this is pretty much &quot;OK introvert&quot;, you know?<p>That over with;<p>Of course, I do think that we should, for a few months, attempt to reduce the spread of the virus, via whatever measures are reasonable!<p>I strongly disagree that the status quo of &quot;you can get on the tube to go and work in a supermarket, but can&#x27;t cuddle your partner&quot; is sustainable.<p>There&#x27;s no guidance.

Not next week, not &quot;if the R number goes down&quot;, not &quot;if Boris has a good day&quot;, we need a date at which it will be legal for people to have autonomy and decide whether they want to take the risk to visit their friends and family, and to make new friends.<p>Notice, by the way, that you&#x27;re not giving any concrete plans for this in your post - it&#x27;s all wishy washy &quot;oh, well, we might do this, or I suppose that, well maybe&quot; nonsense. There&#x27;s no sense of urgency at all. You&#x27;re really not understanding that many, many people would rather die than live in a dystopian world in which people treat each other as virons.

233,clarry,23300233,"&gt; What is the middle ground that permits SOME computation in the client<p>You already went down the wrong road there.  Can you imagine how to add functionality declaratively?<p>The middle ground is extending user agents to support features that improve the browsing experience and enable new functionality, without turning it into an arbitrary application delivery framework.  And yes, this means rejecting and scoping out some things that people do in browsers today.<p>Just like in the past, you as a developer would get to choose whether to write a website (ubiquitous, accessible, runs on grandma&#x27;s old potato, relatively easy and cheap to maintain; these are the things that made the web popular and businesses around the world decided that it&#x27;s ok to to make their product a website even if that meant they couldn&#x27;t have all the features you could with a desktop application), a native application (more effort, more complex, more expensive, more invasive, more friction, more concerning w.r.t. security), or both.<p>To illuminate you, let&#x27;s pick some examples from the false-dichotomy post...<p>Consider form validation.  In fact, this is already done (and could always be extended to support more cases).  HTML5 has built-in form validation that works <i>without</i> javascript.  And of course it&#x27;s still perfectly backwards compatible with old browsers that don&#x27;t do validation; they might send you invalid fields, but you will have to validate them server side anyway because you can&#x27;t trust the client.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Learn&#x2F;Forms&#x2F;Form_validation"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Learn&#x2F;Forms&#x2F;Form_va...</a><p>Static maps have already been done.  Not a super smooth experience, but you could always improve that by speccing a zoomable &amp; pannable tiled image element that&#x27;ll send requests to the specified URL when you pan outside of the loaded area or zoom in.  Add a set of loadable elements that are embedded into this image element and you get something that starts to resemble SVG.  No JS required.<p>Information about points of interest could already be shown with the hover selector, but there&#x27;s no reason we couldn&#x27;t spec an element whose visibility can be toggled with a click, no js needed.<p>Upvote&#x2F;downvote buttons just need an attribute that tells the browser to post the request but stay on the current page.  (This also degrades trivially with browsers that don&#x27;t support the attribute) You could even toggle the visibility of the arrows after posting; similar CSS selectors for checked inputs already exist.<p>In general, there&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t have post or get requests that display the response in a new element without reloading the entire page.  Semantically, not very different from target=&quot;_blank&quot; or whatever you use to load something in a new tab &#x2F; windows, except this time you want the target to be an element.<p>(At this point I&#x27;d also like to note that frames exist and yes they suck but hilariously a lot of the new web does exactly the kind of stateful non-linkable things that framesets were derided for; only worse, because you actually <i>could</i> right-click a frame and link directly to it, but you can&#x27;t right-click and link the arbitrary DOM that was cooked by your client-side javascript)<p>Going with the tiled image element theme, there&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t have more elements that instruct the browser how to load more data on demand.  These same elements could let the <i>user agent</i> decide whether to paginate or scroll infinitely, or how many items to display per page.<p>(There&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t load images progressively and on demand.. progressive JPEG exists already, but for some reason devs still insist on giving me a blur and nothing more will load unless I enable scripts)<p>The way we currently do things really sucks for the user (because they have very little control over how the script behaves; the user agent is degraded to a mere dumb client with little meaningful configurability) and it sucks for developers who would rather just focus on the content and let the browser provide whatever UX fits the user &amp; their platform best.<p>Web devs are in a hurry to paper over the deficiencies of browsers but in doing so (and not fixing browsers), we end up with something worse and every goddamn website becomes a complex application.  We&#x27;re stuck in a worst-of-both-worlds state, where the browser runs applications that lack the power of desktop applications, yet are invasive, heavyweight -- don&#x27;t run on grandmas old potato, complex &amp; expensive to develop and maintain (every website shipping complex UI logic that should be part of the browser instead), increasingly less accessible and less reliable, less linkable &amp; crawlable, less secure.. it&#x27;s all I never wanted.",1590408973,comment,-0.9628,0.085

Biologists and computer scientists learn, in their studies and through lots of experience, a different mindset about how things work.<p>As a computer scientist, finding a solution to a problem, or predicting how a system will behave, is ultimately just a question of having a deep knowledge of the system, plus being a little bit smart about using that knowledge.<p>As a biologist, having a deep knowledge of what you are dealing with plus being a little bit smart is just a starting point for formulating hypotheses that you will then still need to test.

376,lmm,23300376,"&gt; You can have it both way, code evolve. It is pretty common in performance critical code that a minor, almost never call function in one scenario, become a performance critical bottleneck in an other. If you already played with large scaled simulation software, this happened almost every week depending of your inputs on what you are interested to simulate.<p>In which case you&#x27;re in the &quot;worth profiling from day 1&quot; world. It&#x27;s much easier to work on the performance of code when you&#x27;re already working on it and have it in your head - particularly in a verbose language like C++ where it takes a relatively long time to comprehend existing code - so if there&#x27;s a decent chance that the performance of this code is going to be important in the future, profiling as you write saves you time overall.<p>&gt; No it&#x27;s not again. I have been developing in C++ for 15 years, including in the HPC world and I (close to) never had to touch a compiler internal. The language gives you what you need for performances, you do not need to play with that.<p>I said be aware of, not touch. If you weren&#x27;t doing things like memory alignment pragmas then I guess your performance requirements were never so stringent. Fact is that a Java program that&#x27;s fitting its data into L2 or avoiding cache line aliasing will blow a C++ program that isn&#x27;t out of the water.<p>&gt; Theory is what you say. Practice is that 98% of performance critical software in HPC, game industry, physics and High Frequency Trading is in C++&#x2F;C (maybe Rust soon). And this is why.<p>HPC&#x2F;physics follow questionable development practices in a lot of areas, and the games industry follows questionable everything practices. HFT uses a lot of Java and even higher level languages. C++ survives because people are rewarded for being seen to put a lot of effort into performance, and are not rewarded for avoiding bugs.",1590410557,comment,0.678,0.059

429,simias,23300429,"&gt;Wow. To equate logic errors with being clueless?<p>I meant that input sanitization is generally an easier problem to solve than writing safe C. If you can&#x27;t do the former reliably, I&#x27;m certain you wouldn&#x27;t be able to do the latter.<p>Input sanitization should generally be handled very close to the interface, once you went through this step you should expect to only deal with safe data. Memory safety covers the entire application, if some non-critical debugging function 10 level deep in the call stack messes up when it computes the size of a message buffer you can have a remote code execution vulnerability.<p>&gt;Also you assert it is absurd to compare WordPress and openssh In the context of this argument why? They are both widely used software with very high stakes on their reliability and security.<p>Wordpress is a complicated ecosystem with multiple plugins that each can introduce security problems. Its attack surface is also incredibly large since it&#x27;s generally public facing and anybody can interact with a lot of the features by default. That coupled with the fact that it&#x27;s extremely popular make it a very good target for attackers. It&#x27;s also a relatively fast moving target since the web changes fairly fast and new features have to be implemented regularly.<p>OpenSSH does mostly one thing and does it well. Its surface of attack is a lot smaller and it&#x27;s vastly easier to audit and test. Its development is also overseen by the OpenBSD developers, who are famously uncompromising regarding safety. The feature set is very stable and changes very slowly.<p>&gt;Actually it shows memory management is a don&#x27;t care variable.<p>The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. How much development effort went into making sure that these issues didn&#x27;t exist? How many thousands of hours auditing the code and making sure it did what people wanted? In a safer language this time could&#x27;ve been spent auditing other parts of the codebase or implementing other features.<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out that one of the biggest OpenSSH vulnerabilities ever found (in the Debian version of OpenSSH where the maintainer heavily reduced the generated key entropy by mistake) was indirectly caused by a memory issue since the reason for the patch was a false-positive returned by Valgrind regarding use of uninitialized memory.",1590411036,comment,0.9668,0.058

504,mrjin,23300504,"I&#x27;ve read through the article and it turns out to me that he wrote it to show he was lucky enough not to experience a multi-disk RAID failure. Personally I owned dozens of HDDs across almost all brands from desktop&#x2F;laptop HDDS to Enterprise HDDs or NAS HDDs and almost half of them had bad sectors with a life span of a couple of months to a few years, some of which even broke in a row in a few days. The only exception is that in my last batch of 5 Seagate NAS drives, there was no single failure after around 4 years and I think I&#x27;m just been lucky with those as I did hear quite a few people were complaining about the same model.<p>Due to the nature of how HDD works, the surfaces of the disks have more or less defects leaving the factory and were graded by the count of defects, and even the enterprise grade one are not free of defects. Those defects and adjacent areas then are masked by the firmware so that magnetic heads won&#x27;t trying to read&#x2F;write to&#x2F;from them. But that won&#x27;t prevent them from growing. The factories are very clean but the dusts in the air are simply impossible to avoid and if one lands on the disk, it&#x27;s a time bomb. Also as the disks&#x27; capacity grows, the tracks get narrower and narrower. The disks spins from 5400 rpm to 15000 rpm maybe even faster and the magnetic heads are gliding micros from the disk and if the heads touch the disk surface, it almost for sure to create a bad sector event bad tracks. And again, the vibrations are impossible to avoid. Making it even worse, the contact are almost guaranteed to generate debris to be scattered to the whole disk, event goes to other disks sealed in the same case. The bigger capacity, the narrower the track will be, the less tolerant to such contact. Based on the fact, I really don&#x27;t see where he got the confidence the disks people bought were not going to have bad sectors during their expected life span.<p>Also the disks people use to build the RAID are most likely the same brand, the same model and the same batch and thus if one started to have bad sectors, most likely the others are going to have them soon or even worse may already have them. Even if the other disks in the array do not have bad sectors at the time of the failure, they are highly likely going to have during the rebuilding process, why? The load. Take a 10TB drive as an example, my Seagate 10 NAS drive can deliver ~180MB&#x2F;s peak writing and ~80MB&#x2F;s at the trough. Let&#x27;s assume it can deliver 100MB&#x2F;s all the way, and the disk is half full it will almost take 14 hours to finish, this load is highly likely to push other drives to the limit. For RAID6 allows another 1 to fail. For RAID5, if another drive failed during rebuilding, you data is gone. If you had to rebuild a 12 bays NAS, you would know how frustrating it could be, especially when there were secondary failures.<p>Software RAID may somehow alleviate the problem a little bit but it will also cover up the issue. My experience was that once there is one single bad sector, there will be lots of them soon, if you don&#x27;t back up the data and replace the faulty drive on spot, most likely it will be too late.<p>All above does not event consider the setup and quirks of NAS or RAID cards. Put all those issue aside, what&#x27;s are the benefits of RAID for home users? IMO, almost NIL. Our home network device most likely are Gigabyte ones with 1 Gbps ports, which can only deliver about 100MB&#x2F;s, you can see that a single drive can almost saturate that bandwidth even with link aggregation. And most people does not need the random IO boost or extra large volumes come with RAID.<p>My suggestion for home users is to go single drive and stay away from RAID.",1590411589,comment,-0.9939,0.108

It&#x27;s also often useful to go back to biology with an eye for ideas to steal, but rarely are they are useful model to inform biology or biological understanding.<p>As an anecdote, I once had a summer project between the neuroscience and computer science departments at my university.

Or &#x27;Why would I switch from a flashy GUI webapp version of this particular feature?&#x27;<p>Emacs can&#x27;t be appreciated for any one feature, even org mode, powerful as that is. You have to take the entire system and all it&#x27;s possibilities into account. Org mode is particularly special because it integrates so many of Emacs&#x27; features, from literate programming to keeping a Wiki, to scheduling, to keeping a diary, to file browsing, to accounting, to emailing, to so much more. But to try to judge one package like org mode is a bit like judging a car by the quality of its seats.<p>The only thing I&#x27;ve experienced which compares to this is, perversely, the Office 365 suite. Yes, of course, all the functions are completely different and I&#x27;m not making a like-for-like functionality comparison. But in Office365 an email client (Outlook) is integrated with a team&#x27;s documents (via Sharepoint), chats (via Teams), calendar, etc, etc. The value of Office365 isn&#x27;t in any one app, it&#x27;s their integration. It&#x27;s the entire system.<p>Obviously the Emacs system has a completely different and opposing design philosophy to Office365&#x27;s. It&#x27;s ground-up, fully-extendable, initially demanding, text based, exportable, self-hosted, free, and so on.

AMD GPU drivers, for example, are stable for some and unstable for others.<p>The more people involved with building Linux use AMD hardware, the fewer AMD-only bugs find themselves into the kernel. It might also help with optimizing the software for higher core counts now that 32 cores without NUMA is feasible for workstations.<p>In the end I think parts of the core team switching to AMD will make the hardware platform more attractive for people browsing for workstations. AMD provides great value for money but if you want stability, you buy Intel.

I am comfortable with vim bindings generally but don&#x27;t really care as long as there is consistency (pre-baked preferable, but configurable works).

814,Kuzutsukake,23300814,"&gt; It’s the nature of addiction to treat pleasure and happiness as one. The less of an addict you become, the more you’ll realize how separate and distinct these are, and the more weight you’ll place on long-term happiness.<p>The means someone achieves pleasure or long term happiness can in fact be the same. And I see see no reason to believe why a video gaming community (what he refers to as a shallow connection) can&#x27;t provide both. Are you enjoying yourself presently? Great, that&#x27;s pleasure. Is this a sustainable way to enjoy yourself? Great, you are on your way to long term happiness.<p>&gt; We also expose the shallowness of connections that don’t really serve us.

830,nawwal,23300830,"Moscow is a great place to live&#x2F;base, but $800&#x2F;month for a comfortable middle-class life here is definitely an underestimate. I&#x27;m from the US - lived in NYC, Boston, and LA - and have been based in Moscow for the past year; it&#x27;s hard to overstate what an amazing city this is, though it&#x27;s important to note that there is a massive difference between Moscow (or St Petersburg) and the rest of Russia. I&#x27;ve traveled to many places within Russia and they might as well be different countries when compared to this mega-city. Speaking of Moscow specifically: it&#x27;s incredibly beautiful, it has the best metro system I&#x27;ve seen in the world (to the point that some metro stations are actually tourist spots), world-class international food, plenty of museums, shows, theaters, active nightlife, plus all the conveniences you&#x27;d find in the West. And of course there&#x27;s the comfort of a European feel to the city, with the excitement that comes with learning about the Russian&#x2F;Soviet culture and mindset of some people (esp. the older crowd, whereas the younger educated muscovites are basically European). Flights to the main European, US, and Asian cities are cheap and frequent: a roundtrip nonstop flight Moscow-NY is usually ~$300, London can be as cheap as $15 (yes, that&#x27;s fifteen dollars), and I&#x27;ve even booked a flight to Hong Kong the day before flying for like $200 direct. The people are super friendly, and although the majority do not speak English, it&#x27;s fairly easy to find English-speaking Russians or expats if you hang out in the center or know the spots (I have many expats friends who&#x27;ve been here for 2-3 years and don&#x27;t speak a word of Russian beyond saying &quot;thank you&quot;, yet manage to live very active social lives).<p>Having said all of this, however, I am also very aware that my experience here is very different from the average Russian. Being an expat, from the US, speaking English, and being able to afford a comfortable lifestyle in the center give me a much rosier perspective than if I were a low-income worker having to commute 1+ hours to get to work. I&#x27;m ethnically Latino and look obviously not-Russian, so people here are curious about me and act extra nice - especially when they find out I&#x27;m American. It&#x27;s not uncommon for someone to approach me on the street, a park, or a bar just because they heard me speaking in English. On the other hand, however, immigrants from ex-Soviet countries (particularly Central Asia) face discrimination and racism, as do non-European Russians (eg: Russians from the Caucasus region, or the east of Russia), and it&#x27;s not uncommon when looking to rent an apartment to see the words &quot;FOR SLAVS [white Russians] OR FOREIGNERS ONLY&quot;, something that would be completely illegal in the US. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, as an expat from the West I find Moscow to be just about the perfect place to live, but I totally understand the perspective of many Russians or some immigrants that criticize it harshly. I love this city, and I think loving it means also being aware of its shortcomings.",1590413317,comment,0.998,0.037

These people just don&#x27;t get interviewed all that often so it&#x27;s an event regardless of the MC. Probably the same for his entire audience, just different 5% slices.<p>- If you know the old mystery TV anthology show Columbo, he does a similar routine to the titular character: He plays the unassuming everyman and then asks unexpectedly smart&#x2F;pointed questions, using simple terms but with reasonably deep implications. His interviews seem generally well-prepared. They don&#x27;t go particularly deep on any subject matter, but if you&#x27;re familiar with the subject matter they still prompt interesting responses from the guests - you can see someone like Carmack or Musk go into rubber-duck debugging mode trying to digest complicated thoughts into succinct answers and that has an interesting information side-channel to it (it tells you what they really think is important to say or highlight, and Rogan seems to be aware of this - he is good at getting the bits they <i>personally</i> find important).<p>- Related to the above, the macho&#x2F;masculinity slant aside he acts humble and un-obnoxious. I might feel differently if I watched any episode with a guest I really dislike (because he seems to be more accommodating than challenging&#x2F;critical, for sure), but in the episodes I watched I wasn&#x27;t annoyed with him.<p>- Part of his prep is also clearly to read up on recent&#x2F;controversial things related to a guest and probe for it during the interview, so there&#x27;s the shock value&#x2F;titilation factor that adds to the entertainment. His skill is that both him and the interviewee anticipate this but he still puts his subjects at ease enough in the moment to make the responses compelling. It has your brain constantly working to sort through what is guarded and what is not (=real), just like quality reality TV (everyone knows reality TV is scripted -- the entertainment is in trying to identify the sliver of authenticity in people&#x27;s emergent behavior on camera).",1590413326,comment,0.9808,0.034

It is possible to just install whatever you want and then use it for a long time (akin to LTS Ubuntu distribution). But you still need to somehow notice there are critical security updates and you definitely don&#x27;t want to miss them.<p>Another reason is that distro developers create a huge amount of convenient mechanisms and choices for the users.<p>As an example, getting software X to work might not be a problem, but getting X to work along Y and Z when they might have conflicting dependencies might already be a headache. Distro developers will ensure various dependencies are tested and make sense together.

Therefore, we have to resign ourselves to considering tools that:<p>(a) Make efficient, respectful, productive communication the default. Broadly speaking I would define this as making non-intrusive async communication (but making those conversations easily searchable&#x2F;browsable so you can &quot;catch up&quot; if desired) the default.<p>(b) Does not somehow <i>encourage</i> bad behavior.<p>I have plenty of nitpicks with Slack but I believe it passes those criteria.

It got me into self-experimentation - not with any dogmas in particular, but seeing people actually doing rather crazy long experiments gave me some courage. Also he introduced me to a lot of interesting concepts.<p>I haven&#x27;t really seen other people actually do this. The biphasic sleep experiment, and the water fast experiment were especially tough, and no one without serious discipline could do that in my mind. This was years before &quot;fasting&quot; became a thing.<p>He was also an early adopter of both the diet and sleep experimentation (that didn&#x27;t really take of), lucid dreaming and all kinds of other fads i have seen become mainstream later on. So i don&#x27;t think he has &quot;no authority&quot; or whatever, even though he maybe a freak, but i generally like freaks who are on the fringes if they do the work and can write about it.<p>So i thank him for for introducing me to these concepts that i have been practicing for years now, ie. fasting, having an interest in dreams and general worldview, and experimenting seriously with diet (though i eat completely differently than him).<p>So all in all he is very much a self-hacker - he tries stuff even though it&#x27;s weird, very tough and obscure - that&#x27;s a lot of points in my book.

Yes, it is easy to gather everyone and share quick updates, but only in a fast-food kind of way.<p>One big change that I got with my team to do successfully in a company was to change the attitude regarding communication and documentation on Slack.<p>It involved one single, simple rule: whenever you want to ask <i>anything you need to do your work</i> on Slack, phrase it a way that relates to the Wiki&#x2F;Knowledge Base.<p>In our case it was Confluence.

But, if you can use threat modelling to bring your developers into the fold of <i>why</i> they are developing a given feature and what makes it valuable, it makes better developers while ensuring they build security features into their work. The direction of this is business side inward, not technology outward as the author seems to recommend.<p>The threat model is the counter-case of your business model, that is, when a factor fails. Having developers absorb the latest in vulnerability research and threat intelligence is not useful when you can just tell them, &quot;I need you to make sure that a competitor&#x27;s sales engineer can&#x27;t pull this apart and humiliate us in a bake off,&quot; or, &quot;given we&#x27;re in payments, we&#x27;ve got both compliance hurdles and significant criminal threats.&quot;<p>There is more value in educating product owners and product  managers about how to identify and mitigate the counter-cases for their products&#x27; business models than externalizing risk by foisting it on developers who are neither equipped to handle it nor cognizant of it. In a product I developed, I defined threat scenarios as feature level Epics that developers use their skills to build for because people tend to know their own business needs and how it fails better than a corporate security group ever will.<p>Startups typically don&#x27;t need security outside of the bare minimum of compliance rituals because growth really does solve everything, see Zoom as an excellent example of this. I&#x27;m even having trouble recalling a startup that was killed by a security breach.<p>Security is a product level problem.

I already had around 3 years of professional experience in Python and about the same in Common Lisp.<p>Last year I had to create a small utility to help some document scanning process, this included doing some OCR. I had the choice to do this in Lisp or Python or whatever language (I also could as well have written the stuff in Java, C#, C, JS, etc.)<p>Initially I thought &quot;ok, i have good tesseract binding and PDF output libs in Python, where as the Lisp bindings look unmaintained&quot; so i chose Python.<p>Well, back into Python&#x27;s antiquated way of working: No compiler-time checking of anything, and, even worse, upon finding an error, there was no way of correcting the offending function and restarting program execution at that point (restarting a stack frame). No sir, I had to run my whole program again (this was an interaction heavy program) to test it again.<p>So MANY hours were lost in just having to restart the program again and do all the clicks needed to bring back the program to a specific state.<p>Where with Common Lisp those hours would be reduced to zero, since I can modify the program while it&#x27;s running and I can always inspect all stack frames and restart them at will.

The UEFI way of doing things is much simpler.<p>So the idea would be to 1) check whether the installer is booted in UEFI or BIOS, if UEFI then check if an existing OS is installed and whether it boots in BIOS or UEFI mode (whether the drive is partitioned in MBR or GPT), and then decide whether to skip GRUB (for UEFI-capable configurations) or keep it (for BIOS systems).",1590417693,comment,0.219,0.04

1608,fefe23,23301608,"autoconf is a typical GNU project. It looks like it would be horrible and crufty but when you make an effort to get to know it it is actually pretty sweet.<p>Just a little example of how clever it is:<p>If you want to cross compile to a target, you can&#x27;t actually run the test programs you compile. So it becomes important to make them fail at compile or link time, not at run-time. If the expression to be tested is constant at compile time, autoconf will compile a test program that uses the expression in the size of an array type. So, let&#x27;s say you want to check if sizeof(int) is at least 4. Then autoconf would make a test program that declares something like<p>typedef char foo[1-(sizeof(int)&lt;4)*2];<p>If sizeof(int) is less than 4, then the array size would become negative, and that produces a compile time error. No need to actually run the program.<p>That is the place where I learned about this pattern many years ago. I&#x27;m still grateful for autoconf for teaching me that. This is how you did compile time assertions in C before C introduced _Static_assert.<p>Also note that autoconf has lots of other awesome features if you would like to learn about them. For example it can be configured to have a system-wide cache for test results, which speeds up future runs.<p>But the most important part of autoconf to me is that it is dependably configurable. On my system, I have both &#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib and &#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib64 so I can develop for both 32-bit and 64-bit worlds at the same time. Run configure with --libdir=&#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib64 and you are good to go. There is no single way to reliably do this with cmake. Among the conventions, -DLIB_SUFFIX=64 has apparently crystallized out as de-facto standard, but you can&#x27;t rely on it. For LLVM you have to set LLVM_LIBDIR_SUFFIX instead.<p>Or let&#x27;s say you want cmake to also look for include files in &#x2F;usr&#x2F;X11R7&#x2F;include and for library files in &#x2F;usr&#x2F;X11R7&#x2F;lib64. Good luck with that!<p>I&#x27;m not trying to say that cmake is bad. It is a good solution for what it is trying to achieve. But automake had higher goals and also achieved them.<p>But I think cmake vs autoconf is a false dichotomy. cmake is not the enemy here, and neither is autoconf.<p>I&#x27;m actually more disappointed in the hubris of all the people deciding they can make better build systems than automake or cmake and then roll their own, but consistently fail in situations that other people already encountered, thought about, and solved. We now have autoconf, cmake, jam, bjam (Boost), qmake (Qt), meson, waf, python and perl have their own stuff, everybody believes they need to ram a package manager down my throat as well.<p>To me, life time is the only resource that actually matters.<p>For every 5 minutes you think saved by not going autoconf, you made your &quot;build from source&quot; users waste 50 minutes per person to get your build scripts to work.",1590417992,comment,0.9796,0.069

This update would not affect any existing supercomputing clusters, due to the fact that they are not connected to PSN and would not be forced to update. However, it would make replacing the individual consoles that compose the clusters very difficult if not impossible, since any newer models with the v3.21 or higher would not support Linux installation directly. This caused the end of the PS3&#x27;s common use for clustered computing, though there are projects like &quot;The Condor&quot; that were still being created with older PS3 units, and have come online after the April 1, 2010 update was released.</i><p>And in case you were wondering, the reason Sony killed was because they sell their consoles at a loss and make up for that through game sales (which indirectly is what made it so affordable for people interested in cluster computing).

They reproduce let&#x27;s say once per hour, so if you had a liter of them after an hour you would have (1 &#x2F; 5e-15) * 2^24 or 3.3e21 reproduction events.<p>Let&#x27;s say immunity is transferred at a specific spot in the DNA, first three nucleotides in gene X are flipped to ACT.  Spontaneous DNA replication errors happen roughly between every 10e5 and 10e9 replication events. 
 Staphylococcus aureus has ~2.8M base pairs and we need to set a specific three of them to ACT.  My stats are a little rusty but the likelihood of any error happening on the low end is 1:10e5.  The likelihood that this error occurs in the right spot <i>while still leaving a viable organism</i> has to be greater than 1:2.8e6 but not 1:1 or you&#x27;re just spitting out random shit.  Let&#x27;s cut it to 1:1e5.  The likelihood that the output of three base pairs being ACT under random chance is 3^4 or 81.  All of these together i&#x27;m getting ~8e12.  So i&#x27;m being pretty generous here but the likelihood that  you&#x27;ll get a resistant strain would then be ~1:8e12.  With 3.3e21 replication events that gives you almost 2 billion resistant bacteria over 24 hours.<p>Moving to more reasonable values you start with 10µL of staph, spontaneous replication errors every ten million splits and let&#x27;s split the chance of the mutation being in the right area to 5e5.  You end up with 3.3e16 replication events and roughly 1:4e15 chance of getting a resistant mutation or approximately 20 resistant bacteria after 24 hours.<p>Still enough to get the party started.<p>So maybe this case is a little different?",1590419492,comment,0.6942,0.071

Macron is a pro-business former investment banker who has campaigned on reforming labor unions in France, privatizing entities like SNCF, and deregulation generally.<p>Macron is also an excellent example of why the notion that American politics is significantly more conservative Thani n Europe is overstated. In the first round, Macron won 24% of the vote. Fillion (center-right), Dupont-Aignan (Gaullist), and Le Pen (far-right) together had 45% of the vote. That is, nearly half the French electorate was to the right of Macron. The same is true in the UK, Ireland, Germany, and the Netherlands.

The conservative Heritage Foundation consistently ranks Denmark in the top 10 when it comes to economic freedom. While Sanders rails against corporations and calls for sweeping regulations, Denmark, Sweden, etc., have lowered corporate taxes to below U.S. levels and dramatically deregulated their economies. Over the past two decades, while Sanders stood still, almost the whole of Europe became more like America: they privatized state-owned industries, pursued aggressive deregulation, and increased individual choice.

Nationally backed, but shareholder owned and employee run.<p>In any case, the lynchpin to all this trade had to be something that had value at home.. where the ships ultimately returned.<p>The Spanish and other empires before the Dutch &amp; British sought gold directly.

Gold has no inherent value. I think Smith was wrong on the margin, but right on the bigger point. The gold did have value. Kings could use it to raise armies, for example. The Spanish monarchy was always trying to fill its war chest. But, gold didn&#x27;t fuel a trading cycle. Consumer goods &amp; industrial materials did.<p>Anyway... my point is that whatever happened in between leaving London ports and returning, they were returning with goods... not gold. They may have been trading gunpowder for slaves, to be sold in the colonies and exchanged for cotton. They may have traded for spices in India. When the ships returned, they returned with goods. Tea &amp; spices were luxury goods, that beneficiaries of the empire could enjoy. This is important, because it balanced consumption with revenue and created a cycle. Tea sippers had money because they owned shares. Revenue flowed to The Company from tea sipper. The Company used that revenue to keep bringing tea (also cotton &amp; indigo for the mills and other luxury goods like spices). The market was secured (to an extent) by rising share values.<p>When a spanish ship returned with gold, someone had gold, probably the king, probably for war.

In particular I like that in the middle it provides an excellent example of how Marxist theory and vocabulary is deeply steeped* in the Victorian capitalist vocabulary of the industrial revolution and how that model of thinking still affects us today.  Specifically, on HN and the press in general, despite the discussion of “tech” business, the vast majority of businesses are mostly or completely low tech in their operation.<p>I have a quibble with the headline writer (which actually relates to the above): that capitalism didn’t arise without “factories”: as the article shows, the tea production process would have been perfectly clear to Adam Smith.  It was simply low tech (and the article is quite clear about this).  In addition, though “factory” today means manufacturing, in the early days of European empires, the “factory” was the warehouse where goods were stored and financed (factoring accounts receivable is still common today). The factories of the Bombay Presidency were the first effective toehold of British expansion into India.  Over time value add (labor&#x2F;processing) crept into those warehouses as the goods were already there, leading to today’s meaning.

I don&#x27;t know what kind of laptops you&#x27;ve had to run Linux on, but my desktop experience has generally been much better than on Windows. Sure you have the occasional tussle with things that don&#x27;t work at install (although it&#x27;s getting better).

Everything works at install, but then you try to turn Windows into Linux, you tweak at it and you get maybe 80% of the way in. Not bad, you can get some work done.

Ideally, the spec is made loose enough to give user agents &amp; users the freedom to configure the behavior to their liking (and if someone can make the case for a particular behavior <i>must</i> be followed in some situations, then an optional attribute is added to &quot;force&quot; that behavior).<p>In general, I&#x27;m very tired of the status quo, which is that every site developer is responsible for providing good UX and people nag at them, when their preferences could be accommodated for by the browser itself.  As long as the behavior stems from javascript, there&#x27;s very little a browser can do to accommodate user preferences without breaking the web at large.  You know, maybe I don&#x27;t like form validation the way you&#x27;d implement it in JS.<p>People are so vested in the status quo that some of them even get angry when you e.g. suggest that they could use the browser&#x27;s reader mode (instead of nagging at the site&#x27;s author) to make a site readable for themselves.  Bikeshedding about colours and fonts on front page HN postings happens all the time... of course, reader mode is a hack that fails very often, so disagreeing with that suggestion is somewhat justified.  But really, we could&#x27;ve built the web around the user agent instead of vice versa, and then your web browser would be your reader mode by default.  You could blame at your browser vendor or yourself first of all if the colors and fonts (or input form validator behavior before you&#x27;ve entered anything) don&#x27;t please you.",1590421104,comment,0.1134,0.059

Use google calendar to find 2-3 times everyone is available (at least internal people) and send them out, that is the fastest way if you aren&#x27;t already on the phone talking to everyone.  This way it only takes 1-2 communications at most to schedule a meeting.  You have to bake timezone management and meeting process into the company culture, it is really important.

Pivot Table integrations are typically custom-built for each data warehouse vendor or MDX&#x2F;XMLA driver.<p>DuckDB is focused on integrating with the desktop data science platforms R and Python (dbplyr and pandas). Analytics&#x2F;OLAP in SQL means lightning fast GROUP BY queries and more recently SQL OLAP Windows. &quot;SQLite for Analytics&quot; confused me but that is probably due to my own historical mental clutter.

2424,triska,23302424,"Very nicely done, thank you for sharing this!<p>A CLP(FD&#x2F;ℤ) solution such as this one has two parts: First, the relevant constraints are posted. Second, a <i>search</i> tries to find concrete solutions. In general, a search is necessary because the constraints by themselves are not sufficient to deduce the unique solution as that would be computationally prohibitive.<p>You can therefore influence the speed of the logic program in two categorically distinct ways: First, you can post different constraints or try a different formulation altogether. Second, you can try different <i>search heuristics</i> that try to find concrete solutions more efficiently.<p>Regarding constraint propagation, there is a clear trade-off between <i>strength</i> and <i>efficiency</i> of propagation. For instance, the all_distinct&#x2F;1 constraint that is used in the sample solution propagates <i>very strongly</i>, and is therefore <i>much slower</i> than the <i>weaker</i> all_different&#x2F;1 constraint, even though they are completely equivalent from a semantic perspective: Both are true if and only if the given integers are pairwise distinct. It depends on the problem at hand whether the stronger propagation pays off, or whether the weaker propagation is in fact sufficient to quickly find solutions.<p>Especially for very simple tasks such as Sudoku, quick and weak propagation may well outperform strong and slow propagation.<p>In this concrete example, I easily achieved a 20-fold speedup by replacing the all_distinct&#x2F;1 constraint with all_different&#x2F;1, and using the <i>ff</i> labeling strategy to search for concrete solutions. <i>ff</i> means <i>first-fail</i>, and is often a very good strategy. To get this, I simply textually replaced all occurrences of all_distinct with all_different in the source code, and posted:<p><pre><code>    ?- problem(1, Rows),
       sudoku(Rows),
       append(Rows, Vs),
       labeling([ff], Vs),
       maplist(portray_clause, Rows).
</code></pre>
Also, in less than 5 minutes, I just produced all 88 solutions for problem 3 which is shown at the end of the article. This is only due to using <i>less</i> powerful propagation, and a better search heuristic.<p>And this is one of the key attractions of constraint logic programming (CLP): You can relatively easily try different search strategies <i>while keeping the model the same</i>.<p>In Hakan&#x27;s very nice Picat solution, you see that a specific search heuristic is used, specified as:<p><pre><code>    solve([ffd,down], Vars).

Ironically, the fact that this usage sounds wrong might, in fact, be a paradox :)<p>It’s an apparent contradiction between our understanding of the meaning of the word and the actual usage of the word.  The resolution of this paradox could be that there is widespread wrong usage of the word. Alternately it could be that our understanding of the meaning is wrong - which itself could be for multiple reasons. Perhaps our understanding of the definition is incomplete. Or it could be that the definition itself is simply wrong because it doesn’t reflect actual real-world usage.<p>Upon some reflection I think that a core part of the idea of a paradox is that there are many possible solutions to a problem and that <i>some people, but almost certainly not all</i>, will initially fail to even recognize the existence of solutions other than the one they expect, due to unconscious assumptions.<p>Naturally in many cases there will also be people who do not make those problematic assumptions to begin with, but that doesn’t on its own invalidate the use of the word “paradox” in that situation.  The birthday paradox probably fits this definition just fine - ask anyone not trained in statistics about the subject and you’ll likely find a lot of people have unconscious assumptions that lead them to wrong answers, and in some cases thy will even be exceptionally confident in their wrong answers.<p>You might object to the “not trained in statistics” part but that objection itself would be circular - modern statistics education was designed with paradoxes like this in mind, specifically to lay down a foundation that doesn’t lead you down the wrong paths in cases like that.

2463,eropple,23302463,"I&#x27;ve spent the last eighteen months using NestJS. I can simultaneously call it a good step forward in the Node space and something I wouldn&#x27;t use for a new project. They&#x27;ve done a lot of work to build a system that, so long as you stay within very narrow lines and don&#x27;t ask too many questions, feels very cohesive and consistent. The unfortunate part is that it shakes apart at speed if you don&#x27;t do both of those things.<p>People make a lot of hay about the NestJS dependency injection system, and my intuition is that a lot of it is that it&#x27;s a novel concept to a lot of the folks running into it. If you come from a Spring or related background, however, I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that NestJS has a pretty critical misunderstanding of dependency injection. Modules are hardwired together--`BarModule` requires `FooModule`rather than just declaring what they <i>need</i> and what they <i>export</i> and allowing the dependency resolver to figure it out regardless of what module they come from. As-is, you cannot replace a dependency coming from `FooModule` with one, say, from `Foo2Module` without changing <i>every consumer</i>. It&#x27;s a high-boilerplate devolved service locator rather than dependency injection.<p>&quot;Pretty critical misunderstanding&quot; has become my default description of big parts of NestJS as I&#x27;ve gotten deeper into its use over the last year and a half. This description really does fit a lot of aspects of the system. It often feels as though the implementors read half a description of this or that, decided &quot;that&#x27;s a great idea!&quot;, and then implemented that half-a-description...poorly. The &quot;microservices&quot; concept (really just RPC, and not particularly play-nice-with-others RPC) is a good example, as is the really clunky access to WebSockets. CQRS is another prime example, as they&#x27;ve somehow implemented <i>single-node CQRS</i>, made it impossible to distribute, and declared victory and went home.<p>It is better to <i>not provide official support</i> for something if that official support is going to be so full-stop awful, because that official support will choke out attempts to innovate in the space because you&#x27;ve already taken the mindshare for the problem at hand. Which dovetails into the problem that will probably end up putting NestJS in the dustbin as soon as somebody else comes up with a competitor: the NestJS team seems to have what feels like at best an oblivious and at worst a rivalrous relationship with their community and with Node as a whole. Over the last year they&#x27;ve rolled out what read to me as lock-in, don&#x27;t-play-nice-with-the-ecosystem-as-a-whole &quot;features&quot;, like their poorly intentioned CLI &quot;monorepo tooling rather than just using lerna for multi-modulestuff like the rest of the world. Also like the future-forecasted &quot;Nest CLI plugins&quot; for things like linting otherwise bonkers misbehaviors[0]. As somebody who&#x27;s written a bunch of open-source modules for NestJS, I consistently get the feeling that Kamil would really prefer it if developers just shut up and took his stuff and made apps (maybe paying him along the way?), rather than building their <i>own</i> open-source stuff alongside it. I still have a very bad taste in my mouth from the way that they just stomped on the `nest-schedule` project by added a less-featureful but otherwise identical &quot;cron-like&quot; gizmo to NestJS core without so much as a nod to the community member who wrote the better one before they did. The idea seems to be that NestJS isn&#x27;t a community, it&#x27;s a single-source vendor, and in 2020 that&#x27;s weird to me.<p>I&#x27;ve used a lot of NestJS but I can&#x27;t really countenance using it for new projects, and I can&#x27;t recommend it to others.<p>[0] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nestjs&#x2F;nest&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3279"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nestjs&#x2F;nest&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3279</a>",1590423380,comment,0.9577,0.035

2680,throwaway0a5e,23310038,Safe traffic speed is a tautology since (at least per current civil engineering doctrine) speed limits are based on the Xth percentile (where X is usually somewhere in the 75-90 range).<p>Speed limits themselves only have a passing correlation to safe traffic speed.  Almost nobody actually follows them intentionally at scale (traffic just moves at the maximum safe speed which just sometimes happens to be at or below the posted limit) which is why most municipalities are abandoning the &quot;slap a sign with a low number on it&quot; approach for &quot;traffic calming&quot; road features.  Traffic moves at what it considered to be the highest safe speed for the conditions (a bunch of factors too long to list).  You&#x27;re seeing high differences because there&#x27;s many roads that have speed limits that are unrealistically low for light traffic conditions (often below the designed speed of the road) and traffic density (as opposed to visibly or a sharp curve) was the road condition that was the bottleneck on speed on most busy roads.  &#x27;Rona has widened that bottleneck so of course you&#x27;re seeing bigger differences between the posted limits and the traffic speed on those roads (which is probably all roads if you only ever drive during daytime hours in urban areas).<p>Edit: kind of got off on a tangent there but the point I should have made is that speed limits are fixed whereas traffic speed is variable based on conditions.  As conditions change both slowly over time and day to day&#x2F;hour to hour the max safe traffic speed changes.  With &#x27;Rona chopping congestion across the board it&#x27;s no surprise that you see traffic speeds much farther from the speed limit on roads where traffic volume was a big factor in the traffic speed.,1590494599,comment,0.6754,0.024

2769,zbentley,23310127,"A big healthcare company I worked for did this. It worked extremely well, though it wasn&#x27;t without its drawbacks. They adopted the database-per-tenant pattern in the early &#x27;00s, and I truly think it was one of the major things that allowed them to scale to a large number of (increasingly larger in data&#x2F;access patterns) clients. It also made regulatory compliance a bit easier (everyone&#x27;s data is pretty firewalled off at the database-access-credentials layer) I think, but that wasn&#x27;t really my department.<p>We ended up in the &quot;thousands to tens of thousands&quot; of clients range, with thousands of tables per client and a pretty hairy schema.<p>Each customer had their own schema on one of a few dozen giant database servers. The company pushed this idea out to other parts of their infrastructure: separate webserver&#x2F;message broker&#x2F;cache tiers existed for each underlying database server, so outages or brownouts in one component couldn&#x27;t affect other customers&#x27; data that much.<p>Schema migrations, interestingly, weren&#x27;t much of a problem. The practice was nailed down early of &quot;everyone gets migrated during a release, no snowflakes&quot;. That, plus some pretty paranoid tooling and an acceptable-downtime (well, on paper it wasn&#x27;t acceptable, but everyone kinda understood that it was) in seconds-to-minutes during a release made migrations roughly as traumatic as migrations anywhere I&#x27;ve worked (which is to say, &quot;somewhat&quot;), but not too much more. It did take a lot of work to get the tooling right across multiple schemas in the same database server though. Investment in tooling--up to and including dedicated teams working on a single tool without a break-up date or firm mandate other than &quot;make this not suck and keep the lights on&quot;--is critical here, as in most areas.<p>Things that were hard:<p>- Connection management. Others on this thread have pointed that out. Connection pooling and long-lived queue workers were essential, and the web&#x2F;request tier couldn&#x27;t &quot;scale out&quot; too far without hitting connection limits. Scheduled jobs (and this company <i>loved</i> cron jobs, thousands of distinct invocations per tenant) were a problem in the connection-management department. Carefully written tooling around webserver connection reuse, cron-job execution harnesses (they didn&#x27;t really run as cron jobs, they got shipped to a worker already running the code with warm&#x2F;spare database connections and run there--all highly custom), and asynchronous jobs was needed. That occupied a team or three for awhile.<p>- The &quot;whale&quot; problem. When an individual tenant got big enough to start crowding out others on the same database server, it caused performance problems. We eventually worked on a migration tool that moved a client&#x27;s entire footprint (and remember, this isn&#x27;t just databases, but webs&#x2F;caches&#x2F;queue worker hosts&#x2F;etc.) onto another shard. Building this tool was a lot of work, but when it was done it worked surprisingly well. My advice in this area: build a good manually-initiated&#x2F;semi-supervised migration system. Leverage underlying database technology (binlog based replication). Don&#x27;t hesitate to get very dirty and custom with e.g. replication logfile formats, and don&#x27;t assume that $off_the_shelf_data_replicator isn&#x27;t gonna collapse when you want to do online per-schema replication in massive parallel from the same database (not even if that tool cost you millions of dollars). Do <i>NOT</i> succumb to the allure of &quot;we can automate the bin-packing and it&#x27;ll constantly rearrange clients&#x27; datasets for optimal resource usage!&quot; Manual is just fine for data migrations that big. Worst case, part of someone&#x27;s job is to initiate&#x2F;supervise them.<p>- SPOFs sucked. Some datasets weren&#x27;t per-tenant at all; sometimes client companies merged together or split up; some data arrived intended for a tenant but wasn&#x27;t tagged with that tenant&#x27;s ID, so it would have to go into some separate database before it found a home. These systems were, bar none, the biggest liabilities, causes of production issues, and hardest things to code around in the entire company. You&#x27;d think that having to write application code for thousands of logical databases across all the per-tenant schemas would suck, but in reality it wasn&#x27;t too hard. It was making sure your code didn&#x27;t accidentally talk to a SPOF that was the problem. My advice here: microservices do not help with this problem. HTTP, gRPC, or raw database wire protocol: if you have dependencies on a &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;-type used-by-everyone server sneaking into your nicely sliced up per-tenant architecture, those callsites are going to be the cause of your sleepless nights. Get good visibility into where they occur. Favor &quot;push&quot; into per-tenant models over per-tenant code doing a blocking &quot;pull&quot;. Even if the push approach causes massive additional complexity and work. The costs of pull are too great.<p>- Some database specific shit (even on polished hosted offerings from AWS, or big-budget Oracle installs) will start acting really squirrely when you&#x27;re talking to thousands of identical schemas on the same database server (and thus tens or hundreds of thousands of identical tables with different data). If you double down on this route, be prepared to have a few really, really good database folks on staff. I don&#x27;t mean &quot;help me fix my slow giant reporting query&quot; people, I mean &quot;familiar with the internals&quot; folks. Example: query plans can be cached based on query <i>text</i>, globally, across an entire database server. Different schemas have <i>super</i> different clients, and thus super different data distribution among 100s of GBs of data. The plan that gets cached for query X against client A is the product of running heuristics&#x2F;histograms&#x2F;etc. across client A&#x27;s data. That plan might perform pathologically when query X runs against client B (on the same database server)&#x27;s data, and finding out how&#x2F;why is really annoying. Solution: bust the cache by a) happening to know that SQL comments aren&#x27;t stripped from query texts before the text is used as a plan-cache key and b) prepend each tenant&#x27;s identifier to each query at the database-driver level to prevent cache pollution. Result: you have traded a spooky query performance issue for a query-plan-cache-size issue; now your queries are all predictably slow because all your tenants&#x27; different queries are thrashing the plan cache. Tradeoffs abound.",1590495157,comment,-0.7087,0.072

Despite evidence [0] [1]<p>It really depends on why someone is saying it. If one is saying it as an observation of statistics, then it&#x27;s fine (usually. There are contexts where it is not; it&#x27;s not a set of facts you should point out to a group of students about to take a college entrance exam, for instance). If you&#x27;re saying it in the context of a causal inference, such as, for example, the Damore memo, then it&#x27;s falling into the trap of conflating correlation and causation that has traditionally unfairly banned women (and men) from entire allowed modes of participation in society.<p>&gt; Yes, at one point in time oppression from one sex against another was real in intellectual pursuits, be it academia or certain areas of interest. And there are instances of it today. But it’s not as pervasive as so many commentators or inclusion boards want it to be.<p>I agree. Many commentators want it to be far less pervasive than it is. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still very pervasive. We are no more than two generations removed (in the US at least) from women being generally overtly barred from working in most industries. We are only a scant 100 years out from women in the US being allowed <i>the right to vote.</i> It hasn&#x27;t been enough time for the difference of fact to permeate into a difference in opinion; old prejudices die hard.<p>For example, the rest of your comment indicates you believe that the differences we see in society are biologically rooted. That&#x27;s precisely the question the jury is out on; we <i>used</i> to believe it was true, but psychology has come to understand much better how profoundly deep cultural indoctrination and phobia of new cultural patterns run. Before we make claims like &quot;Men and women on average have widely different personalities, based purely on biological sex,&quot; we need to be extremely sure we isolate out cultural effects, which is damnably hard to do.<p>Your example of knitting, specifically, ahistorically excludes the Celtic culture [<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thefencepost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;when-men-knitted-a-surprising-history&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thefencepost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;when-men-knitted-a-surpris...</a>].

And?<p>I mean, sure, that sucks for people in the local labour market, but if you cannot find work that covers your cost of living, then you either have to change your work or lower your cost of living. This is the same in any type of work, in any location. For example, you might make enough money running a small town bakery, then big office opens up, local cost of living rises (like it has in San Francisco, for example) and suddenly you can’t sustain yourself anymore. You either have to do something else or move somewhere else.<p>My point isn’t that things don’t have an effect, just that companies want to embrace remote, that location shouldn’t be coupled to compensation, outside of implicitly due to locations effect on what an employee would accept. The employee can then make a decision on their own worth and values and choose whether they would rather do their location-non-specific work from a high cost place (that presumably has other benefits[1]) or if they would rather move to a low cost place. This shouldn’t matter to the company and shouldn’t have any impact on how they value the employee.<p>[1] If there is no benefit to living in a high cost location, for a given individual, then its not exactly smart ir prudent for them to stay there and keeping the prices high (due to higher demand) isn’t benefiting anyone. (Proximity to friends and family is, of course, part of the equation). I can’t expect my career of choice to pay me more just because of my personal choices or preferences, though.

2968,atrettel,23310326,"I agree with this basic idea, though I understand why some people have a difficult time seeing it.  VI and Vim are advertised as &quot;modal&quot; editors, but in fact they are just editors that accept a rather terse command language.<p>I originally never wanted to use Vim but had to use it often at work (especially in the server room), so I got used to mechanically entering and exiting insert mode as many people do.  That was the extent of my knowledge, but then during a slow period at work I took the time to learn Vim thoroughly by reading &quot;Learning the vi and Vim Editors&quot; from O&#x27;Reilly.  It changed my view of VI and Vim to the point that (as I had said) I now think of them as command-based editors rather than modal editors.  Once you realize that each key press is a command in a very terse language, you can see the power and expressiveness of the language, but it takes some practice and time to build up your intuition.<p>For example, I often find myself typing something like &quot;79a-ESC&quot; or &quot;79i-ESC&quot; to put in a horizontal rule in text or Markdown documents.  To somebody thinking modally this command makes little sense, since I leave insert mode immediately after typing a single character!  But from a command language perspective it makes total sense, since I merely instruct Vim to append 79 dashes to the current line.  Once you see that it&#x27;s a language, you stay in command &quot;mode&quot; much more, since that is where the power is.",1590496624,comment,0.7678,0.012

Lots of people, up and down the socio-economic spectrum work hard in this sense.  It&#x27;s not a helpful distinction.  And I&#x27;m not impressed by hard work in this sense.<p>I have often wondered what it is, exactly, that VCs and executives and SVPs and bankers do that makes their services so valuable and so venerated.

I remember a seminar on AI Safety where the vehicle AI had a problem with plastic bags in the air and it would swerve to avoid them. No human would have an issue with that.<p>I worked in innovation for a bank looking at automating all these kinds of things and even spent a few days doing the jobs (and this was eye-opening) and I was a developer, so not a manager looking at a job spec, but someone who would have actually done the work. 90% of the job could be automated, but 10% was dealing with wacky exceptions, many of which they had never specifically seen before. We had someone who had the job of taking PDFs and extracting tables of income and expenses. They were generally standardized PDFs, so that seems like something good to automate right?<p>Well, no. As tons of the financial advisors had added custom rows which the person doing the input had to interpret into another column. It was quite eye-opening that while the jobs were menial data entry, it was nowhere near as mundane as one might imagine as the guy was still making a judgment call on whether to classify &quot;farm income&quot; under a person&#x27;s investment income category or whether to classify it as regular income for the purpose of investment advice.<p>I have a friend currently on a robotic process automation internship with another bank. Same issue. When the RPA dev people actually go and do these jobs, they realize that is frequently deviates from the approved job spec with the people in them making small but significant judgment calls.<p>It is not a lack of knowledge about what AI can do in either of those cases. It is not a lack of data as both banks have armies of people doing it and millions of clients. It is that for AI to do the job, all manner of other things would need to be standardized and reformed and if that were done, why use AI to solve the problem in the first place as a lot of it would simply be computational.",1590496922,comment,0.9576,0.035

What you described is just like the good ol&#x27; days of DOS were: you could write some code, sometimes, that would work on everyones machine - but then of course there were special cases and developers had to take into consideration other members of the ecosystem - standards had to be proposed, formulated, and met - competing players needed to play nice together, and so on.<p>The trouble with Javascript today is that precisely NONE of the lessons learned in any of the other places where PRECISELY these issues were experienced, have been applied - even less, paid any attention.  And, especially not, by any of the so-called &#x27;new school&#x27; of developers who think such disasters as the left-pad fiasco are Just Fine™.<p>The cognitive load of Javascript today is equivalent to that of, lets say .. assembly on DOS in the 80&#x27;s.  &quot;Anyone&quot; can do it, and no doubt there will be great advances in applications for the user - but don&#x27;t come screaming when the big ball of mess starts costing you more than if you&#x27;d just written it properly in the first place.  That means, packaging and abstracting things properly.  It means putting the modules in a place where the world will find them over time.  It means having release planning procedures that work, and aren&#x27;t in the hands of a mindless entity.

If they hadn&#x27;t had such a hard-on for removing basic compilation capabilities from a <i>default OS install</i>, we wouldn&#x27;t have all been corralled into the web, and thus relieved to &#x27;finally&#x27; have a dev tool for the common man available to us, in Javascript.<p>The cognitive load is the same.  The ecosystem is a disaster, however.  I&#x27;d rather just be writing plain ol&#x27; Linux apps, producing binary-file based installers, personally .. the tipping point for the effort to invest in Web development is there.  I just need users willing to run real operating systems, and who realise that the web isn&#x27;t just about the browser.  I feel that is a more worthy investment of the intellectual capital of developers, today.<p>Of course, none of this matters to the billion-dollar Javascript churn industry.

Yes and no. It was amazing because it let us isolate each user. 
With Filesystem backups we could restore just in time the data from each user without having to reset the whole database and with little to know system knowledge.<p>At the same time it restricted our choices when improving the product.

Bigger refactorings are harder and you need much more depth when you think about big new features.<p>I still think it was a nice solution, but this solution came also because we didn&#x27;t knew a thing about partitioning in databases and we weren&#x27;t expert in clustering.

3296,wcarey,23310654,"This is a lovely (edit: having been in similar shoes, also terrifying-in-the-moment) example of a broader problem in teaching mathematics: the language we use to describe mathematical reasoning is a natural language, like English or Latin, and therefore full of the sorts of bizarre irregularities you&#x27;d find in a natural language.

3376,butdotheytho,23310734,"honestly, having given it much thought, i don&#x27;t think this is actually the case.<p>all i can say in a short comment on my reasoning is:
1. works of art done for love or the need to share are peices of content probably worth spending very valuable time on
2. works of art created for money are inevitably optimising for wasting your life - films and books are dragged out to series that largely go no where, vacuous music and media is created in the hope of getting you to spend money, not expanding your mind and adding to the value of society
3. historically this doesn&#x27;t really seem to have been an issue. if you are good you can make money out of commissions and guest appearances or signed copies etc. this is not perfect, but it certainly makes it more likely money will go to the creator rather than a distributor. - note also the current system is far from perfect and many creators suffer from its failures today
4. nothing is done in isolation: inevitably you created your thing based on what you learned from others and opportunities society gave you.. but most importantly the value comes from other people need, NOT your creation - ability to write code is not valuable, removing someones problem is.
5. controlling and restricting the ability for other to create as they are not creating how some right holder wants seems drastically counter productive and greatly slows progress and de-motivates people who could be adding to society.
6. if we got better about respecting what others had contributed to our ideas (as we felt less need to hoard them) then overall i think people would be worried less when its someone else take on their idea that &quot;makes it big&quot;. if thre was less ot be gained financially, it would remove incentives for deceit.<p>i suppose in summary, i think that you should create out of love and because you think that thing needs creating.  if all &quot;for profit&quot; inventions and art were to vanish from existence, i don&#x27;t actually think we would be missing much. there is no race we are trying to win with progress and there is no final state to get to.",1590499111,comment,0.9896,0.098

B2C ML systems can get it wrong, and customers are generally forgiving, because it&#x27;s a low stakes game. B2B applications are generally higher-stakes, because they impact business workflows, and if someone has decided to automate it, it&#x27;s probably a high-volume, critical workflow. It has to be extremely accurate, and demonstrably better than the equivalent human system.<p>The problem has to be well-defined enough that an ML system can act with high-accuracy, but not well-defined enough that a rule-system could replace it. Don&#x27;t use ML if a rule-system will do a better job. (For those scenarios, you can still put an ML anomaly-detection system to make sure the rule-system is still valid, and to guard against data input changes.) As just mentioned, the problem also has to be important enough and high-volume enough to warrant an ML solution. The percentage of problems that fulfill these criteria is not very large.<p>Now to actual ML development and deployment - the model is the tip of the iceberg. The rest of the iceberg is data acquisition, feature selection, data&#x2F;feature versioning, automated training, CI&#x2F;CD, model performance monitoring, et cetera. If ML is being developed inside a software development organization, this isn&#x27;t a problem, most people will understand this. If it is being developed within an embedded BI team inside a business unit - they will generally not have support&#x2F;runway needed to build the full system. The ML model might make it to production, but it will probably run naked, be brittle, and hard to retrain. A dramatic failure with business impact is just a matter of time.<p>There are a lot of low-code, no-code ML solutions that have been developed, or are being developed, and some of the supporting infrastructure as well, but, at the risk of sounding parochial&#x2F;protectionist, you need a rock-solid, end-to-end, integrated, data management system that is fully understood by whomever needs to pick up the phone at 2AM. It&#x27;s the interfaces that are hard, and chaining together a bunch of third-party black-box systems just means more interfaces and behavior you don&#x27;t control. Choose and use these systems wisely.<p>So yeah, B2B ML is hard. But it&#x27;s generally not due to lack of data, and transfer learning is generally not necessary. Understanding business processes is important, I agree, but that&#x27;s comparatively easy. It&#x27;s what consultants have been doing for decades. The hard part is choosing a problem where ML can add value, and then executing on it with enough integrity that people will actually trust it.<p>(1) Ok, clickbait might be harsh.

A &quot;super app&quot; seems to be another way to provide that consolidation, but is there more to it than indexing?<p>A user is basically having a chat with their device. The UI is the language available for the user to form queries. The more flexible the language, the more the user may express complex queries. But users don&#x27;t really want to learn a complex language, they want something either &quot;intuitive&quot; or matching their interests from the beginning (ie, opening up the search possibilities, or narrowing down to a usable set of targets). Because intuition is only made from analogies of accumulated knowledge, the former can only be constructed by having the app capable of understanding (possibly a subset of) the user language, which leads to Siri and the like. The later by reducing the scope of the super app to a template of interests, which could either fixed (mainstream topics), or determined from a set of existing models by having the user go through a questionnaire at app install to narrow down their interests to a manageable subset.<p>I think that for now the key factors are:<p>(1) consolidation of information, because the user doesn&#x27;t want to jump through each of their accounts or data sources to find what their looking for.<p>(2) automatic connection of different services (banking, online markets, and perhaps many other use cases); this is only relevant for services which are not equipped with a protocol to deal with a given form of connectivity.

Sure, if you&#x27;re talking about the neural nets used in Google translate or YouTube recommendation system, or any big tech company domain of problem that is based on <i></i>vast<i></i> amount of data with extreme size of state space and variability - fine.<p>But we are not talking about interpretability of the result but the <i>reliability</i> of it, and in robotics domain you rarely have to tackle that size of state space, but rather a highly <i>noisy</i> one.<p>Let&#x27;s take your example of low level control of bipedal robot. At whatever stage of control&#x2F;manipulation you&#x27;re talking about, you <i></i>always<i></i> have to consider that the input will have some noise, and how to handle it. This is the reliability; you know how to(or how much) of the input noise you can handle, and how much you will leave (or amplify) to the rest of the system. Based on this you also know the <i>limit</i> of the system, so you can also get an indication of failure. You can make AI&#x2F;Neural Network to consider the noise and also give an indication of failure, but you have to think about that from the data gathering step! Most control algorithms have this: &quot;what input noise can I handle&quot; question answered; The same requirement should be set to the data.<p>I assume you thought about Reinforcement Learning of sorts when you thought about control, but what most people don&#x27;t realize is that those algorithms works only because you can use high precision sensor that reduce these noise level (combined with sensor fusion) to negligible level. But now you&#x27;re relying on high precision, extremely expensive sensors. They almost always fail when you get out of the lab and have to suddenly consider <i>cost</i>. (and at this stage traditional control algorithm creeps back)<p>Let&#x27;s take a real example. On my original comment I wrote &quot;work in lab at 1pm&quot; and I weren&#x27;t sarcastic. Apparently not only did the AI solution (in Computer Vision) I were given only work in the lab, but <i>at the exact lightning condition under high noon at the lab</i>, with all the ceiling lights on all the time. We are now not talking about interpretability of the AI, but the reliability; This is <i>easy</i> to identify beforehand. You can also mitigate this (the lightning noise) by including it in the model (data). This should have been glaringly obvious if the person actually knew his toolset rather than just retraining a existing model using tensorflow magic.",1590500133,comment,-0.806,0.053

Maybe it because it easy and quick, or because it makes for good signaling to the in-group.

Even if Scheme were just as mature and stable, I&#x27;d guess that Common Lisp would still be an easier choice if the output target was C++.<p>Scheme is rather functional by nature and has a core reliance on things like proper tail calls and continuations. These require elaborate, whole-program compilation so they can be optimized away. A side effect of that kind of in-depth manipulation will necessarily be output code that is far removed from the layout of the original source (making it harder to understand what is happening or hunt down bugs).<p>Common Lisp <i>can</i> do functional things, but the core of the language is much more imperative. You&#x27;ll wind up writing looping constructs instead of tail calls (tail calls aren&#x27;t actually part of the spec though some&#x2F;most implementations support them). CLOS can probably map onto C++ classes without too much trouble as well. These lower-level constructs make it easier to reason about performance.<p>That alone isn&#x27;t everything. Common Lisp allows you to provide type hints and type specifiers to the compiler. Aside from the speedups they allow in CL, they would certainly make things easier when translating to C++. If that isn&#x27;t enough of a boost, basically every major CL implementation allows you to define an inline assembly block.

They wanted China to open up its labor market, so that foreign companies could exploit cheap labor in China. The consumer market in China was tiny, whereas the American and European consumer markets were huge, so the relationship could not be symmetric.<p>Now, China&#x27;s consumer market is actually quite large, and foreign companies play a huge role in that market. I didn&#x27;t just mention Starbucks. I also mentioned VW, but I could equally have mentioned Boeing, Apple, Intel, Qualcomm or Micron. You&#x27;ll notice a trend here: the US exports high-value-added products to China (including IP licenses and services). Most of what you have in your living room that&#x27;s actually manufactured in China is lower on the value chain.<p>Over time, in other words, the US trade relationship with China is becoming more symmetric. Huawei&#x27;s development into high-value-added products is a sign of that. It&#x27;s actually this symmetry that the United States wants to avoid, because it means China becoming a peer-level competitor.<p>The US trade relationship with China will never become fully symmetric, though, because the US runs a net trade deficit with the rest of the world, for reasons that appear to me to have to do with the United States&#x27; unique financial position in the world.",1590503189,comment,0.3818,0.061

4242,bearjaws,23311600,"For context, we implemented your exact model at my job prior to switching to &quot;conventional multi-tenant&quot;. I agree with your premise that there are a lot of off the shelf tools to help this, but in enterprise I feel like we hit dozens of other issues and our customers didn&#x27;t even care if they shared the same database as someone else.<p>If the production environment is extremely similar to dev, the problems are numerous, how do you ensure that a bug in one app server doesn&#x27;t let users access other request data? We solved this via multiple app servers, but then how do you solve deploying to hundreds of individual app servers? We have 12 services per customer, replicated to 4 physical locations, that means 12<i>4</i>500(customers) 24,000 containers to roll out any upgrade completely. (99.99% SLA)<p>Also some customers get different services depending on their tier, so now we need to bake in some form of Salesforce integration into our deployment so we know which services to start up(we didn&#x27;t do this unfortunately, so all services started up and some didn&#x27;t do anything).<p>If you split into many physical database servers vs many &quot;logical&quot; databases, how do you monitor that an individual customers performance is adequate? What about APM? One NewRelic instance per customer? One ELK cluster per customer? How do your developers &#x2F; customer support engineers get access to a specific customer instances both in the software, in the database and APM? I cannot fathom having to manage 500 ELK clusters, even with AWS managed Elastic search.<p>How do you enable ETL and reporting solutions that support all these databases. What if you have data aggregation rights and need to combine different customer&#x27;s data? What happens when your product team needs to report across all customers to determine what features to work on (gotta be data driven)?<p>Maybe this is only related to healthcare (where I work), but in our industry I cannot imagine our health systems and manufacturers not wanting answers to these. These answers are infinitely simpler in our new multi-tenant model vs our old multiple host model. Writing the processes and documentation around guaranteeing segmentation took less than 8 hours and is only 3 pages of our entire security model. Hi-trust specifically calls out many of these points, and I am sure SOC-2 does as well.<p>In my experience, not a single one of our health systems or auditors has had an opinion either way on this. They only care when you aren&#x27;t doing APM properly, or taking the necessary steps to prevent attacks both from external parties and by internal parties. We do in-depth third party audits that are shared with our customers. Ensuring good processes for managing risk is always more important than wishful thinking that a design pattern will make your enterprise model work.<p>Our total lines of code for logical segmentation takes up less than 300 lines in all of our services combined.<p>Finally, given that Postgres10+ now natively supports row level security, I fail to see why anyone starting a new project would choose the multiple database option when you can bake in authorization straight into the DB at the lowest level.<p>Sorry this is really long, but I wanted to share my experience &amp; thoughts.",1590503528,comment,0.9949,0.036

He then flooded all the file sharing networks with this copy so as to make it difficult to find legitimately complete copies.<p>The entire first quarter or third was used to get readers heavily enough invested into his novel to _want_ to run out and buy the official copy -- he _justified_ the effort and expenditure to his readers, and they responded (mostly) positively by actually doing so!<p>Granted, there was a lot more to it than that, but this was the basics, and it pushed a lot of people towards not just his eBooks but also his physical sales.

That’s the benchmark you compare floating-point to decimal conversion—your algorithm is no good if it doesn’t handle all cases.<p>The start of the art back in the 1990s the algorithm used in dtoa, written by David M. Gay and included in Netlib, taken from a paper by Steele (I think). Since then, people have chipped away at the problem, making it faster. A few new algorithms have appeared, including Grisu and Ryu.<p>Something you’ll see in these algorithms is some “fast path” which uses ordinary double arithmetic, and then logic to detect when this gives the wrong answer and fall back to some slower path. The slower path may use arbitrary precision arithmetic or something else (Ryu avoids bignums!). These new algorithms generally hit the slow path <i>very</i> infrequently, which is why you sometimes see benchmarks with numbers picked to trigger the slow path.<p>The algorithms have associated papers proving their correctness for all inputs.

It is exceptionally difficult to maintain cohesiveness as a team given that there are 0 hours per day that we are all online.    What has ended up happening is that we have virtually fragmented into 3 separate teams with our own products.  For instance, my team members in Asia are working on a product that I can&#x27;t effectively support because my shift doesn&#x27;t overlap.  If someone asks me a question about that app, which my team is supposed to support, I have to go start reading source code.

Is breaking the second law of thermodynamics &quot;impossible&quot;? Time travel? Wormholes? FTL?<p>Engineering is ultimately limited by physics and the physics for a space elevator are dire. You need a material with a tensile strength such that it can withstand the centrifugal forces of being 35,000km+ long including having a counterweight pulling on it to counterbalance the force of gravity acting on the mass of that.<p>At this point only theoretical materials come close to that.<p>But even if you can solve the tensile strength problem (and that may well be solvable) you&#x27;re left with a structure that isn&#x27;t really as useful as you might think.<p>Even getting between the geosynchronous point and the Earth requires speeding up and slowing down for a distance of 35,000km+.

An orbital ring:<p>- doesn&#x27;t require any magical materials.

At 20 meters wide you&#x27;re talking ~1 billion square meters of area, which is almost as large as the land area of Los Angeles;<p>- allows for huge amounts of solar power to be generated and sent to the ground via transmission cables;<p>- provides you with enough delta-V to escape the Solar System for almost no cost; and<p>- has significantly more attractive failure modes.

Combining groups of B boys and N people total, you get B1+B2 boys and N1+N2 people. Let&#x27;s use @ for that operator, just to not distract from the usual addition. a&#x2F;b @ c&#x2F;d = (a+c)&#x2F;(b+d).<p>Let&#x27;s combine a group of 1&#x2F;3 boys with a group of 2&#x2F;3 boys. 1&#x2F;3 @ 2&#x2F;3 = 3&#x2F;6. But 1&#x2F;3 = 2&#x2F;6, so that should be the same as 2&#x2F;6 @ 2&#x2F;3 = 4&#x2F;9. But 3&#x2F;6 isn&#x27;t 4&#x2F;9. You end up with this issue of a&#x2F;b @ c&#x2F;d = p a &#x2F; p b @ q c &#x2F; q d = (p a + q c) &#x2F; (p b + q d), which can be anything. So we have the conclusion that if this operator makes sense, then all numbers are equal. You end up with a notion of numbers that is useless for the original problem of combining groups of people of different genders.<p>What we should do here is define it on pairs of numbers rather than fractions. A fraction and a total (p, N), or the number of boys and number of girls (b, g). The latter is super straightforward: (paul, jenny) + (bob, alice) = (paul and bob, jenny and alice), so numerically, it&#x27;s (b1, g1) @ (b2, g2) = (b1+b2, g1 + g2), but (1, 3) is not (2, 6) here, unlike with fractions. Real simple. If we want to connect this back to the world of fractions, (p1, N1) @ (p2, N2) = (number of boys &#x2F; total, total) = ( (p1 N1 + p2 N2)&#x2F;(N1+N2), N1+N2 ).

4809,carapace,23312172,"&gt; We know that prolonged lockdown of the entire population has delayed cancer treatments and has made people with serious disease like heart attacks avoid going to the hospital. It is leading hospital systems to furlough and lay off personnel, it is devastating mental health, it is increasing domestic violence and child abuse, and it has added at least 36.5 million new people to the ranks of the unemployed in the United States alone. Many of these people will lose health insurance, putting them at further risk of declining health and economic distress. Prolonged unemployment is estimated to lead to an extra 75,000 deaths of despair in the United States alone over the coming decade. At a global level, disruption has increased the number of people at risk of starvation to more than a billion, suspension of mass vaccination campaigns is posing a threat of resurgence of infectious diseases that kill children, modeling suggests an excess of 1.4 million deaths from tuberculosis by 2025, and a doubling of the death toll from malaria in 2020 is expected compared with 2018.<p>I am not an expert, but it seems to me that most of those problems would have occurred <i>without</i> the lockdown, due to the effects of the virus spreading unchecked.<p>In other words, economies were always going to take a massive hit one way or another, but with the lockdown we get some control over the form it takes.",1590506100,comment,-0.977,0.165

4874,4cao,23312237,"The history of Microsoft is the history of workarounds on top of workarounds, year after year, rinse and repeat. Here&#x27;s a novel thought: instead of providing yet another iteration of workarounds for the power user, how about just fixing it for every user.<p>Take for instance the Start Menu. When the Win-X &quot;quick access&quot; menu was added years ago, it was essentially an admission that the Start Menu is not the best way to start at least some things. It didn&#x27;t really get much better since but the Search and Run functionality was integrated into it. Now one of the PowerToys replaces the Win-R menu as a yet another clumsy attempt at fixing the Start Menu by bypassing it. And it seems no new functionality beyond what is already implemented elsewhere is being added, except everything will of course get a different alternate look. Some more discussion about it here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;PowerToys&#x2F;issues&#x2F;44"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;PowerToys&#x2F;issues&#x2F;44</a><p>It looks like there isn&#x27;t anyone at Microsoft who can take a look at the big picture and decide what they actually want to accomplish with the UI in the medium run. Different groups of people come and go, keep adding different things, abandon them, after a while somebody else starts off with yet another approach in parallel without drawing any conclusions from the failed previous one, etc. The lack of co-ordination really amazes me.

If you&#x27;re a developer, and unless you&#x27;re using MS stack (.NET), the experience has been always subpar.<p>I have to agree with the author that the experience is not quite there yet. But a lot of progress has been done. And I hope the progress continues and maybe in the future I&#x27;ll try it again.<p>For me there is not a single deal breaker, but it&#x27;s just a thousand paper cuts. Removing those will take time. Some of the annoying things I encountered:<p>1. Overall slowness. It&#x27;s not only startup, it&#x27;s in general. Not only on heavy tasks like parallel compiling, but even for lightweight stuff, you immediately notice when you try a real linux.<p>2. Some config like setting up ssh-agent correctly are hard and different than a real linux. No idea why.<p>3. Windows Terminal development is quite fast, and sometimes things change or break. For instance, the background color of my terminal suddenly changed and I had no idea why. After some googling and modifying config, it was fixed.<p>4. The fact that it required to sign in for Windows Preview program. (I think this is not required anymore) but it was very annoying as it requires very long updates that require like a million reboots. No idea why Windows has to reboot so many times for a single update. Additionally, after every update there was always surprises. From the harmless Edge popping up from nowhere asking you to become default browser for the nth time, to some hardware misconfiguration. Nothing too bad, but annoying.<p>5. (This one very subjective of course) The windows UI overall is, how to say it, a mess. Font rendering is awful. The mix of old style UI with new style UI is horrible. Some settings will be in new style, some other settings will be in old style.<p>As I said, I might try again in the future. But now I switched to Fedora and I&#x27;m really really happy with Gnome 3 and good old real Linux.

Besides that simple issue though I think it mostly comes down to poor maneuvering on hard surfaces which somewhat limits them to snow&#x2F;sand&#x2F;mud, and the drivetrain is probably more delicate and difficult to maintain than tracks which discourages military use. One of the big advantages of tracked vehicles in a military context, for example, is that they do not get flat tires. A rolligon could easily lose an entire bag. I&#x27;d imagine they probably carry spares and tools to swap them but no one would want to do that on a battlefield.<p>From what I have read, they are, in general, not really designed for <i>survivability</i> like most off-road vehicles we think of, but rather for payload.

You do understand that the switching ASIC is just a PCI device right and that you cannot just pump all its bandwidth into the CPU for review? The path between the data plane (ASIC) and control plane (CPU) is limited, generally only a few gigs in today’s high end switches. Anything you want to do in the data plane has to be programmed on the ASIC. The only packets that are punted to the CPU are control  plane are ones that need software processing and are low bandwidth, such as LLDP, STP, BGP control, etc. This is done by programming a switch ASIC table call “my station” or “l2 user”. On some kit you can tcpdump a front panel port to the CPU but it is rate limited as you can kill the CPU or stop processing of vital control plane packets (let’s DDOS the STP process, fun). Looking at traffic flow on the CPU on a 32x100g is not gong to happen. You need to sample, so sFlow, Netflow, etc. So given the limited bandwidth and any tools need to know how to translate your Linux configuration into Ethernet ASIC pipeline programming what is it you want to do that you cannot do today?<p>Random note. I worked at a switching startup (a few). At one we always ran own latest code. After an update to a core switch everything looked good, but then people started to complain things where very slow. Went looking. Switch looked fine but dropping traffic towards CPU which should not happen. In checking the cacti graphs for that switch (10 second polling) all the graphs that showed the ports between the different networks were exactly the same flat line at a max of 134MB&#x2F;s on 10G pots. Hum, strange. Hold on, that sounds like the max BW between the ASIC and the CPU port! Let check some bits in the ASIC configuration. Yup. New build forgot to set HW routing on in the pipeline so every packet was punted to the CPU for route processing. Lucky control plane policy had the STP etc, packets at a higher queue.

Folks who like the current name are always bringing up a couple of examples of Native Americans who say they “don’t care” about the name, and claiming that it’s really only white liberals who are offended; meanwhile, in my experience, the large majority of Natives actually do care very much, and are upset that a racial slur used for their ethnicity is being used as the name of a sports team.<p>I found this comment rather funny, because if CGP Grey is correct [0] the preferred term <i>by American Indians</i> is &quot;American Indian&quot;, NOT &quot;Native American&quot;. So you&#x27;re claiming knowledge of the general opinion of a group, while not using the group&#x27;s preferred name for themselves.<p>0: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kh88fVP2FWQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kh88fVP2FWQ</a>",1590507403,comment,0.6767,0.031

5196,hwillis,23312560,"Nuclear reactions don&#x27;t just make EMPs; it&#x27;s not like nuclear plants are emitting continuous electromagnetic interference.  Nuclear EMPs are created when radiation ionizes susceptible atoms, creating charged particles via Compton scattering.  That&#x27;s why high-altitude nukes create much more intense EMPs; the low-density atmosphere is much easier to ionize.<p>Gases at low pressure are DRAMATICALLY easier to ionize than anything else- think fluorescent tubes, etc.  Dirt will not be highly ionized by an underground explosion, although I can&#x27;t actually find anything about underground EMPs.  It is safe to say that the EMP will be very greatly reduced, though.<p>The EMP is dangerous to electronics because it creates a voltage gradient over a large area.  A 5 volt gradient across a few inches of ground plane will destroy most electronics permanently.  A semiconductor is painstakingly embedded with atoms that create an intrinsic voltage difference across a tiny sliver of silicon; a mild voltage in the wrong direction will erase that gap.  It will not destroy wires, since the pulse is extremely short.<p>Forget erroneous measurements.  The EMP would kill the computer if it was just a plain wire.  You&#x27;re talking about picking up tens of thousands of volts across any kind of protection circuit.  The only possible way this works is with <i>some</i> protection, ideally shielded wire like a coax cable.  If that&#x27;s the case it&#x27;ll just cause a brief (&lt;10 microsecond, mostly) flash of current to ground.  Modern Ethernet is twisted pair, but the first ethernet was coax and the first R58 was sometimes shielded.<p>There are other types and components of nuclear EMPs but they mostly aren&#x27;t important in this case.  There are several highly questionable things about this story- the PDP-11 would need a pretty skookum power supply to not bottom out, the motivation is... strange, the ethernet wire would need to be incredibly long, etc. etc.  EMP is probably not one of them, at least as far as the <i>quality</i> of data.  EMP becomes irrelevant if you can access raw data or the ping uses anything but the simplest impulse waveform.  Assuming you can actually collect data in the first place, anyway.",1590507897,comment,0.5405,0.065

On the other hand, I&#x27;m sure that making these guarantees have at times constrained the things that .NET can do with its garbage collector.<p>Java, by making the GC a plugin, has certainly spread its efforts thinner. It&#x27;s also turned the Java-facing side of the memory management subsystem into a somewhat scary and mysterious black box, since that very swappability means that the application itself can assume almost nothing about its behavior.

Sonja Trauss is right that building more housing would reduce rents of both high- and low-end apartments. Tim Redmond is right that building enough housing to make much of a dent in prices would change the visual character of most streets, although the result could be more like Barcelona than like the Hong Kong that he fears. The unsettled question is which of these is the higher priority.<p>&gt; Building enough housing to roll back prices to the &quot;good old days&quot; is probably not realistic, because the necessary construction rates were never achieved even when planning and zoning were considerably less restrictive than they are now. Building enough to compensate for the growing economy is a somewhat more realistic goal and would keep things from getting worse.<p>&gt; In the long run, San Francisco&#x27;s CPI-adjusted average income is growing by 1.72% per year, and the number of employed people is growing by 0.326% per year, which together (if you believe the first model) will raise CPI-adjusted housing costs by 3.8% per year. Therefore, if price stability is the goal, the city and its citizens should try to increase the housing supply by an average of 1.5% per year (which is about 3.75 times the general rate since 1975, and with the current inventory would mean 5700 units per year). If visual stability is the goal instead, prices will probably continue to rise uncontrollably.<p>&gt; If you want to do your own analysis, the data is all available to download on Github.

5280,jcrawfordor,23312644,"As a bit of very purely My Opinon on the matter, I have always felt that there is great significance to the connection between the Bell system and Manifest Destiny. In the classic book Cadillac Desert, Marc Reisner argues that the American drive towards irrigation agriculture in the West must be viewed not as a practical matter but as a <i>religious</i> one, both on the obvious level that a large part of the movement (e.g. the Bureau of Reclamation) descended from the Mormons (<i>cough</i> LDS) for which it quite literally was a religious value, and on the deeper level that the government pursued irrigation projects with great gusto when they made absolutely no economic sense, and the government knew that---so there must be something deeper driving the efforts.<p>I would view the telephone system through a similar lens. The famous painting &quot;American Progress,&quot; frequently used to illustrate school lessons on manifest destiny, depicts not only the tide of pioneers headed west but, even more prominently, <i>an angel stringing telegraph wire</i>. This connection between the telegraph (and later telephone) and manifest destiny, and between the telegraph <i>and deity</i>, does not seem incidental.<p>It was a widely held opinion through the late 19th and early 20th century that instantaneous communication through the telegraph and telephone was a fundamental component of civilizing the nation, key to American progress. It was closely coupled with the railroads in that regard, both in the spiritual sense that both opened the West to reclamation (which at the time had a meaning more like exploitation, in the sense of natural resources), and in the practical sense that the early telegraph system was often operated by railroads.<p>So, perhaps at some basic level, there is a fundamental difference between the telephone system and the cable television system: the telephone system is an artifact of an era of unbounded American expansion and optimism, and so was founded with a strong sense of the &quot;American values&quot; of exceptional quality and dedication to purpose. The cable television system, on the other hand, only came to fruition in the 1950s, by which point it was coming of age in a post-war America in which capitalism was held as a greater value than expansionism and exceptionalism, manifest destiny having in good part died with the tremendous shock of the great depression.<p>Just something to think about when you consider how history drives technology today.",1590508175,comment,0.9913,0.031

Here&#x27;s [1] the Portal on Norway, there are hundreds of articles on Norway and Norwegian culture. From what I can see, the Norwegian Wikipedia does not cover Norway <i>that</i> much more, even though you can reasonably expect that it&#x27;s primarily authored by Norwegians.<p>There are fewer but still hundreds of pages about e.g. Zimbabwe, its history, culture, politics, demographics etc.<p>I fail to see what&#x27;s being not presented there.

We&#x27;d see a lot more information about Zimbabwean wild life, nature and environment, but we&#x27;d still see articles on lasers, genetics, space travel, the history of Arabic numerals, because there&#x27;s really no reason to believe that Zimbabwean scientists wouldn&#x27;t have looked into these things etc.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Portal:Norway"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Portal:Norway</a>",1590508348,comment,0.8526,0.056

One reasons is that humans have small working memories, and novice mathematics students have even smaller ones. The ambiguity of notation, while confusing, once mastered, allows us to write shorter expressions, whose meaning we resolve from context, and which become both easier to write and to understand.<p>A second reason is that while mathematical logic is rigorous and precise, unequal mathematical objects are similar to each - even objects that on first glace seem nothing alike. For instance, the two types of inverses you mention, or sets and linear spaces, or groups and tetrahedrons. And because of the diffuse nature of mathematical objects, it is inevitable that the same notation will be used for unequal objects. Because, it advances our human understanding of mathematics to use the same notation for two unequal but similar objects.<p>This second reason, once understood, is one threshold between the mechanical mastery of the intermediate student and almost artistic use of mathematics by the advanced student.",1590508504,comment,0.0258,0.046

Instead it has balkanized (not on its own of course, but by allowing implementers too much of a choice and too few hard rules, too much SHOULD instead of MUST).</i><p>So you call people out for their shoddy products until the SHOULDs are practically adopted as MUSTs. Is there a legitimate reason for some network appliance with any form of persistent storage that you can write to once or more to use different DUIDs through its lifetime? Nope. If it does it&#x27;s badly implemented. Do burn-in, just like you do with MAC and print the DUID on the box, just like you do with MAC. How you achieve that is no concern of the DHCPv6 protocol, just as how the MAC address is derived or whether it&#x27;s printed on the box is no concern of the DHCP (v4) protocol.<p>Perhaps one can say that there is a lack of standardization in the area of human friendly physical machine to address mapping. DHCPv6 and DHCP (v4) are not those standards. Instead we have the ad-hoc practice of printing MAC address stickers which could just as easily be the ad-hoc practice of printing DUID stickers if not for an apparent complete lack of imagination on the implementers&#x27; part.<p><i>&gt; The conclusion will inevitably be: IPv6 isn&#x27;t there yet, because it&#x27;s too much work for little benefit.

This would also include a significant portion of people who are themselves elderly or infirm, and they don&#x27;t want to risk society neglecting to protect them if everyone else is allowed to go about their business.<p>It could well be that if the fatality rate really was &gt; 3%, you would have a hyper-majority in favor of taking action, which means we would have all been in agreement about how to react, really locked down hard and eliminated it by now.",1590509097,comment,0.9571,0.095

5623,jeffbee,23312987,"Not a big fan of this pattern. I feel like the state of the application should be maintained in the usual way, with just some struct fields or global variables.  It is easy for any reader of the code to understand what is meant by a statement like `bytesReceived += msgLen`. To observe this state, you can have a function that reads and exports bytesReceived, on demand and when&#x2F;if needed. This provides for the best flexibility and maintainability of the system, since you will be able to change your observability stack at a later time, or have more than one of them, without changing the stats-keeping statements at the point where they appear in the application code. This also provides the best scalability and performance since you are able to aggregate separate counters from multiple threads, if needed, minimize or optimize locking, etc.<p>The problem is there are a lot of off-the-shelf observability frameworks for Go that require the pattern in the article: you emit a value to a hook function at the point of production. This sucks at any reasonable scale because you are now required to just take a global lock (or write a channel, which is the same thing) every time you record a value.

5696,cesarb,23313060,"&gt; Traffic appears at core routers because it already gets send there by peripheral routers as a gateway. Sharing routing information between peer routers is not unsolvable nor likely onerous. Strawman solutions (flood constantly) are being deliberately dense.<p>If by &quot;sharing routing information between peer routers&quot; you mean that, when a router learn of a new host, it shares that information with its peer routers, which then share that information with their peer routers, that <i>is</i> flooding. Without flooding, the traffic would not appear at <i>every</i> core router, which means most routers would not know of your host.<p>&gt; I suspect because, folks are so very comfortable with what they know, and so very unwilling to extend themselves.<p>I once seriously considered how to make an Internet-scale non-hierarchical routing protocol, where the host identifier was a cryptographic hash of its cryptographic public key. The reverse path is easy; once A has successfully sent a packet to B, all routers in the middle know how to get from B to A. The forward path (from A to B) is the hard one. Every router knowing every host is non-viable; consider, for instance, what happens when my phone roams from the WiFi to the LTE and back (which happens many times per day) - if every router had to know of that change, for every roaming phone in the world, it would be enough to overwhelm all the links between them, not to mention their CPUs. I came to the conclusion that the amount of propagation of the route updates <i>must</i> be limited for it to be viable, so having every router know of every host is not possible. Either the routing information must be summarized somehow (which is what the hierarchical routing used with IPv4 and IPv6 does), or some other way which does not involve the routers (for instance, path routing, like MPLS) must be used.<p>That is, I&#x27;m not rejecting your idea because I &quot;feel comfortable&quot; with hierarchical routing, I&#x27;m rejecting your idea because I&#x27;ve already given it (or something like it) serious consideration, and found it harder than what I had initially thought.",1590510130,comment,0.9443,0.035

My Samsung TV came with a pair of active 3D glasses that were collecting dust. On the other hand we&#x27;ve had adoption of touch screens on handheld devices, it almost swooped the entire mobile market between 2007-2012 after iPhone&#x27;s introduction. But the same thing didn&#x27;t happen with Keyboard + Mouse input on a desktop computer. Infact, the market just exploded with new mechanical keyboard aficionados sometime around 2010, I still remember hanging out on geekhack a decade ago and now mechanical keyboards are everywhere.<p>We&#x27;ve seen in the past and we will see this in the future - a whole lotta focus on aesthetics, UI and presentation - i.e., cool graphics in video games, touch screens, holographic displays like the one in the article, AR&#x2F;VR tech (magic leap?) without proper attention to content will lead to nowhere. Probably just make headlines.<p>Another thing is that people don&#x27;t take ergonomics into account. Pretty much any sci-fi movie has people moving their arms about to interact with content. That would never take off in real life. Unfortunately, people like Elon Musk are hell bent on horrible UI&#x2F;UX depicted in their favorite sci-fi movies and shoehorning it into Space craft (dragon capsule has all touch screen interface with literally no buttons, checkout the Everyday Astronaut channel&#x27;s tour). Elon&#x27;s vision about UI&#x2F;UX is misguided through movies, it is embarrassing. The giant touch screen panel in a Tesla is the main reason I would never get one. I think he might put this 8k Holographic display as an option, please don&#x27;t tweet him about it.<p>Sci-fi movies are the cancer of design. It is the victorian design equivalent of modern times, pure decoration.

5853,derefr,23313217,"&gt; I don&#x27;t think a &quot;programming mindset&quot; is particularly rare ... coders are reluctant to admit this because they like to see themselves as intelligent in a unique way compared to other professions<p>A programmer is exposed, all day long, to clients who do not have the &quot;programming mindset.&quot; There are two possible reasons for this:<p>1. Selection bias — people who have a &quot;programming mindset&quot;, just don&#x27;t end up being the clients of software firms, maybe because they decide to build things themselves. (Unlikely, IMHO: to avoid needing to get someone else to build software for them, they would need to go out and learn the trade-skill minutiae of programming on top of their regular career; few people do this. Also, anyone with a sufficiently-lucrative primary career can see that this is not their comparative advantage, and so won&#x27;t bother, just like they won&#x27;t bother to learn plumbing but will instead call a plumber. If these people <i>did</i> exist in sufficiently-large numbers, they would end up being a non-negligent part of software firms&#x27; client-base. But this does not happen.)<p>2. Representative sampling — <i>most</i> people really just don&#x27;t have this mindset.<p>Yes, there are exceptions, but they&#x27;re the exceptions that prove the rule. The &quot;domain of mental best-fit&quot; of programming heavily overlaps with e.g. mathematics, most kinds of engineering, and many &quot;problem-solving&quot; occupations (e.g. forensic investigators; accountants; therapists and behavioral interventionists; management consultants; etc.) But <i>all</i> of these jobs <i>together</i> are still only amount to a tiny percentage of the population. Enough so that it&#x27;s still vanishingly rare for any of them to end up as the contact-point between an ISV and a client company.<p>-----<p>Another thing we&#x27;d see if the &quot;programming mindset&quot; were more common, would be that there&#x27;d actually be wide take-up of tools that require a &quot;programming mindset.&quot; This does not happen.<p>We&#x27;d expect that e.g. MS Access would be as popular as Excel. Excel wins by a landslide, because while it certainly is <i>programmable</i>, it does not force the sort of structured approach on people that confers benefits (to speed of development and maintainability), but only feels approachable if you have developed a &quot;programming mindset.&quot;<p>We&#x27;d expect that Business Rules Engines and Behavior-Driven Development systems would actually be used by the business-people they&#x27;re targeted at. Many such systems have been created in the hope that business-people would be able to use them <i>themselves</i> to describe the rules of their own domain. But inevitably, a programmer is hired to &quot;customize&quot; them (i.e. to translate the business-person&#x27;s requirements into the BRE&#x2F;BDD system&#x27;s dialect), not because any <i>programming</i> per se is required, but because &quot;writing in a formal Domain-Specific Language&quot; is itself something that&#x27;s incomprehensible without a &quot;programming mindset.&quot;<p>We&#x27;d expect that people who want answers to questions known to their company&#x27;s database, would learn SQL and write their question into the form of a SQL query. This was, after all, the <i>goal</i> of SQL: to make analytical querying of databases approachable and learnable to non-programmers. But this does not happen. Instead, there&#x27;s an entire industry (Business Intelligence) acting as a shim to allow people with questions to insulate themselves from the parts of the &quot;programming mindset&quot; required to be able to formally model their questions; and an entire profession (business data analyst) serving as a living shim of the same type, doing requirements-analysis to formalize business-people&#x27;s questions into queries and reports.<p>-----<p>Keep in mind, the &quot;programming mindset&quot; I&#x27;m describing here is not a <i>talent</i>. It&#x27;s not genetic. It&#x27;s a <i>skill</i> (or rather, it&#x27;s a collection of micro-skills, having large overlap with problem-solving and research skills.) It&#x27;s teachable. If you get a bunch of children and inculcate problem-solving skills into them, they&#x27;ll all be capable of being programmers, or mathematicians, or chess players, or whatever related profession you like. The USSR did this, and it paid off for them.<p>The trouble with this skill, as opposed to most skills, is that people that <i>don&#x27;t</i> learn this skill by adulthood, seemingly become gradually more and more <i>traumatized</i> by their own helplessness in the face of problems they encounter that require this skill-they-don&#x27;t-have. Eventually, they begin to avoid anything that even smells a bit of problem-solving. High-school educators experience the mid-development stage of this trauma as &quot;math phobia&quot;, but the trauma is generalized: being helpless in the face of one kind of problem doesn&#x27;t just mean you become afraid of solving <i>that</i> problem; it (seemingly) builds up fear toward attempting to solve <i>any</i> problem that requires hard, novel, analytical thinking on your part.<p>And that means that, by adulthood, many people are constitutionally incapable of picking up the &quot;programming mindset.&quot; They just won&#x27;t start up that part of their brain, and will have an aversion reaction to any attempt to make them do so. They&#x27;ll do everything they can to shirk or delegate the responsibility of &quot;solving a novel hard problem through thinking.&quot;<p>And these people, by-and-large, <i>are</i> the clients of software firms.<p>They&#x27;re also, by-and-large, the people who use most software, learning workflows by rote and never attempting to build a mental model of how the software works. This has been proven again and again in every software user-test anyone has ever done.",1590510880,comment,-0.4894,0.07

It&#x27;s not so easy to derive this rule if you&#x27;re working in the space of real world things.<p>And sure, I agree you can ad hoc extend the analogy of tables to bring it in line with the underlying mathematical rules, but then your analogy is no longer as simple as it was. The complexity is leaking out of the abstraction you had it under.<p>&gt;The important thing here is to help students build the intuition that mathematical notation shouldn&#x27;t be treated mechanically, you should think about what the notation represents<p>Sure, using abstractions and analogies is a powerful way of teaching. All I did was point out that analogies have limits and at some point they can become detrimental to understanding the fundamental concepts.<p>This is a common complaint by Physicists when doing public lectures on Quantum Mechanics and then having people extrapolate from the metaphors to derive incorrect physical rules (e.g. faster-than-light communication from a shallow understanding of quantum entanglement).<p>&gt;because it deals with an improper translation of the English into mathematical notation.<p>It isn&#x27;t just about the improper translation to English.

The fourth-grader logically extended the analogy that they were given because conceivably, there could have been an operator defined that matched their intuition, for example, let&#x27;s call it 
&#x27;@&#x27; and define it (not rigorously) as &quot;a&#x2F;b @ c&#x2F;d = (a+c)&#x2F;(b+d)&quot;. This operator, if existed, would work very well for combining tables of boys and girls and getting the fraction of girls to match the fourth grader&#x27;s intuition. The fourth-grader is learning fractions for the first time, and that operation could have conceivably existed - so the only reason they were wrong is that they haven&#x27;t been told what the rules of fraction addition are and NOT that they misunderstood the analogy.

6006,ash,23313370,"One of the commenters gave a great suggestion:<p>&gt; I would use bar models to show how the whole changes.
First, draw one bar (table) with 3 students inside; label the bar one whole, star one student and label that student as one third of that whole. Do the same thing beside the first bar model, again showing the bar as one whole, starring one student and labelling that student as one third.
Then, push the two bar models together (I’d use a Smart Board) to show a new whole: the two bars together with 6 students in the one bar is labeled as the new whole.
Point out that this is a NEW whole, with a different # of pieces. Now they would see the 2 starred students in the one new bar made up of 6 total students, so the “old” 1&#x2F;3 student becomes the “new” 1&#x2F;6 student once the whole changes. This is like a name change, once the size of the whole changes.
You can also show them that by cutting each “student” in half, you would get an equivalent fraction of 1&#x2F;3 = 2&#x2F;6 of the first one whole bar. So 1&#x2F;3 = 2&#x2F;6, not two 1&#x2F;3’s = 2&#x2F;6.<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marilynburnsmathblog.com&#x2F;can-1-3-1-3-2-6-it-seemed-so&#x2F;#comment-27347"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marilynburnsmathblog.com&#x2F;can-1-3-1-3-2-6-it-seeme...</a>",1590511598,comment,0.8316,0.007

Afaik, this is primarily a platform for zero-cost transactions (and if you live in an emerging market, a way to stop your govt stealing from you).<p>But you wouldn&#x27;t need to charge rates on the Libra system...you still implement monetary policy as before because Libra is just a currency backed by other currencies.<p>Given the currency shares announced though, it would potentially make monetary policy harder for non-US nations (i.e. EUR&#x2F;GBP&#x2F;JPY). My sense is that wouldn&#x27;t be catastrophic but it would reinforce the position of the dollar&#x2F;US monetary policy (as an example: if I am the ECB, I try to cut rates to zero then everyone just buys Libra until banks run out of money and force me to hike...this can work in reverse too where a big shock to the US economy can transmit through Libra globally...so functionally I think it would be very like a gold-exchange standard i.e. 1920-1970 but with USD as the exchange currency).<p>Btw, this is why you saw European nations come out so strongly against this. SDRs are basically the same thing but the IMF overvalued the EUR in the basket...this is why central banks don&#x27;t really use SDRs. Libra is kind of the opposite where you have a realistic weighting of EUR which is obviously less good for the EUR (although, again, no-one uses SDRs and they haven&#x27;t helped the EUR become less of a bad currency).<p>...but yeah...it definitely is complex because the needs of consumers&#x2F;corporates for low-cost transactions runs counter to the needs of monetary policy.

It is actually okay to add ratios (as fractions) by combining the numerators and denominators, no common denominators needed. In my opinion, ratios should not be written like fractions until later after students have conceptual understanding and fractions should never be taught with sets in the 3-5 work.

Often times these interactions are small but still impacting, other times they are intense and moving like hearing first hand explanations what it was like to live through atrocities from around the world and what it takes to escape but they all hold meaning and a life lived only surrounded by large groups of the same often leads to everyone eating the same things, enjoying the same art and music and missing out on, or even understanding the things outside of your own bubble.

This was originally one long paragraph, but I&#x27;ve added paragraph breaks for readability:<p>---<p>&gt; At the time, I let it go so I could think and regroup myself. There was more than fractions to think about: Is it possible for both equations to be true: 1&#x2F;3 + 1&#x2F;3 = 2&#x2F;6 and 1&#x2F;6 + 1&#x2F;6 = 2&#x2F;6. This was a long discussion that kept their interest, in which I learned that many (most?) of the students didn’t think of fractions as numbers. That was another hurdle. I kept going back to what we know about adding whole numbers.<p>&gt; Then I took another approach, once I was sure that they understood that 1&#x2F;3 and 2&#x2F;6 are equivalent, so how can I add a number to itself and wind up with a sum that’s the same as one of them? In all of these discussions, students would change their thinking. We looked at adding on a number line. I used pattern blocks to explore the same problem. I kept talking about keeping our attention on what was 1 whole.<p>&gt; My, this all takes time, and the time is important for students to develop, cement, and extend their understanding.

Sure, there are limits to particular intuitions, but all of the rules make perfect sense with real world quantities.<p>For example, 1&#x2F;3 of an orange + 1&#x2F;3 of an orange is actually 2&#x2F;3 of an orange, not 2&#x2F;6 of one. And 1&#x2F;3 of 1 kg of flour is exactly 2&#x2F;6 or 300&#x2F;900 of that kg of flour. Sure, it&#x27;s hard to talk about 1 Graham&#x27;s number &#x2F; 3 graham&#x27;s number of 1kg of flour, so it does break down at some point, but unless you go overboard with quantities, all of the rules for fractions are in fact intuitive, and important for day to day things like cooking and money management. In fact, fractions and their operations are probably older than the idea of abstract rules, because they are fundamentally useful things.<p>The child in this example wasn&#x27;t even making the mistake of thinking the rule for + is the rule for your @ operation. They were confused because they were trying to apply the intuition they had built up for how to translate real-world problems into fractions in the wrong way. Their result was in fact physically true: it was true that 1&#x2F;3 of the children at one table + 1&#x2F;3 of the children at the other table was equal to 2&#x2F;6 of the children at both tables. This was confusing them because it suggested a different way of manipulating the numbers than they had just been shown.<p>The right solution, again, was to teach them how to translate &#x27;a fraction of something&#x27; to rational numbers - that is, to multiply the fraction by the something, with only a special notational case when that something is 1. If they had known to do this, their intuition would have translated directly into the correct algebraic formula. No need to learn the abstract rules yet.",1590513087,comment,0.9144,0.069

I see some consequences as holding nothing but irreversible harm and thus outweighing any benefits free expression of those ideas may bring.<p>I mean take anti-vaxxers for example, if enough people become anti-vaxxers and don&#x27;t have their children vaccinated - herd immunity is compromised, children get sick, some of them die.

The cost is the charging ports. So start with one, reserve the space for EVs and make it expensive.<p>Then people won&#x27;t want to use it. Most of the time they&#x27;ll charge at work or some restaurant that installed a charging port to drive customers to its business.

You might have ten EVs in the area and one charging port because at any given time only one person is willing to pay that much to use it. Which also means that it&#x27;s regularly in use and can recover its costs quickly. But then it&#x27;s there if you really need it, so more people can feel comfortable buying EVs.<p>Then once there are more EVs, you can install more charging ports -- they&#x27;re paying for themselves, after all, as long as you don&#x27;t install so many they don&#x27;t stay in use.<p>Then once you&#x27;ve paid off the capital cost you can lower the price, so more people use them, so you can build even more. When you have 10 charging ports but 9 are already paid off, you only have to charge 10% of the original premium to pay off the 10th.

Effectively you would buy the book and use any DRM scheme you want as the DRM would verify that you owned the ERC-721 before allowing the media to be used.<p>2. True, there is always smart contract risk. The DAO hack happened right after Ethereum was founded as nobody really knew what they were doing and tooling was extremely basic. Things are still in the early dial up days for crypto but even now tooling is vastly better,  there are dedicated firms for contract&#x2F;code auditing and the systems being created today are much more robustly designed. With that said, nothing can be certified 100% safe and the only concrete proof of security we have is the passing of time itself. These systems will be new for a while and adoption of this tech will happen slowly over time in the same way the internet grew over two decades into what we know today. There will likely be a system that withstands the test of time and becomes old enough to be trusted by even conservative developers, but until then there will likely be mechanisms built-in where the content creator can destroy and re-create tokens in case of failure. Not every token will be this way and the decision is up to the content creator themselves.<p>3. This is a problem for wallets in general and lots of people are working on it. The leading solution seems to be social recovery which is where you designate trusted addresses (family members, hardware wallets, friends etc) and configure it to allow your wallet to be recovered if say 3 of the 5 agree that you legitimately lost it. If you ever lose your wallet because you forgot the password or your computer&#x2F;phone died then you can recover it easily and safely, no complicated and technically hard key backup systems needed which is key for normal non-HN people. You can also set outgoing filters so your ERC-721 tokens couldn&#x27;t be sent unless it&#x27;s to a whitelisted address or you verify it with another of your trusted addresses, so even if a hacker got into your wallet they couldn&#x27;t transfer the tokens and you would just recover your wallet using the system above.

6491,PaulJulius,23313855,"I really think the negativity in the comments here is overblown, and misdirected.<p>The author has a totally reasonable set of requirements: React + TypeScript, writing posts in Markdown, small amounts of interactability, and static site generation. It may be an indictment of the JavaScript ecosystem and the current state of the web that nothing exists that can help the user accomplish this out of the box, but that doesn&#x27;t diminish the validity of the author&#x27;s requirements. (It&#x27;s also possible that next.js, Gatsby, or another framework can actually support these with relatively little configuration.) But we should applaud the user for wanting to create a totally statically generated site! (I noted that Gatsby&#x27;s homepage was not static generated and clearly takes a second before displaying content.)<p>Given that the author wants to render to static HTML, I interpret React + TypeScript to primarily mean JSX + TypeScript. Is this really any different than saying Liquid + Ruby, or Go templates + Go (used by Jekyll and Hugo respectively)? JSX and React&#x27;s component based system were literally designed for HTML, and I&#x27;d argue it is definitively a better solution than the raw template libraries offered by other languages. You get automatic &quot;syntax&quot;-checking of the HTML by using JSX. By using JavaScript you have proper control flow instead of the awkward in-line conditionals and loops in templating libraries. A Component-based system makes code-reuse significantly easier. And by using TypeScript you can get type-checking for all of this. Unfortunately, using JSX and TypeScript means that you need some sort of build pipeline, and that&#x27;s where the current state of JavaScript really rears its ugly head and adds a lot of complexity.<p>Writing posts in Markdown is also totally reasonable, as is wanting to support small amounts of interactability in future posts. A couple of comments mention that you could just add raw HTML to a Markdown file and call React from there, but that doesn&#x27;t solve the compilation problem. A lot of comments also missed the desire for interactivity. It&#x27;s for a developer blog!

Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.<p>And still we connect people.<p>The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is de facto good. It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned.<p>That isn’t something we are doing for ourselves. Or for our stock price (ha!). It is literally just what we do. We connect people. Period.<p>That’s why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we do to bring more communication in. The work we will likely have to do in China some day. All of it.<p>The natural state of the world is not connected. It is not unified. It is fragmented by borders, languages, and increasingly by different products. The best products don’t win. The ones everyone use win.<p>I know a lot of people don’t want to hear this. Most of us have the luxury of working in the warm glow of building products consumers love. But make no mistake, growth tactics are how we got here. If you joined the company because it is doing great work, that’s why we get to do that great work. We do have great products but we still wouldn’t be half our size without pushing the envelope on growth. Nothing makes Facebook as valuable as having your friends on it, and no product decisions have gotten as many friends on as the ones made in growth. Not photo tagging. Not news feed. Not messenger. Nothing.<p>In almost all of our work, we have to answer hard questions about what we believe. We have to justify the metrics and make sure they aren’t losing out on a bigger picture.

6683,corty,23314047,"As far as I&#x27;ve understood, they wanted a little of everything.<p>IPv6 addresses should be more static short to medium term, because you don&#x27;t have to reassign. Your local pool is basically infinite, so e.g. a client logging off the WiFi doesn&#x27;t mean you immediately have to recycle the address. The local part (the latter 64 bits) is enough for everything and everyone.<p>Now, the first 64 bits should be used for routing, which should preferably be more hierarchical than with IPv4. The idea was that a customer&#x2F;company&#x2F;small ISP would get a prefix assigned that was below the hierarchy of the upstream ISP (with IPv4, that hierarchy isn&#x27;t possible because there aren&#x27;t enough address bits, and lots of lower-tier customers got their own subnets). So a large ISP might be assigned 2345::&#x2F;16, assign 2345:6789::&#x2F;32 to a smaller ISP who might assign 2345:6789:abcd::&#x2F;48 to a customer (who then will do more subnetting with that). That keeps the global and local routing table small, since everyone just needs to look at the address prefix to know where to route to. If the customer now moves to another ISP, he is assigned a new prefix (e.g. 4711:f0f0:666::&#x2F;48) by the new ISP and needs to renumber, meaning that all the customers addresses keep their suffix but change their prefix. Protocols like SLAAC where designed as stateless to support (among other things) quick and easy renumbering. Just announce the new prefix, wait a TTL and you are done. Clients automatically switch over to the new addresses, in an ideal world this is mostly transparent to the end user.<p>In the new millenium, especially after Snowden, the argument of privacy got stronger, meaning that randomised local &#x2F;64 suffixes are now en vogue, as opposed to the earlier MAC-based static suffixes.<p>Therefore everything is more dynamic and also more static ;)",1590514524,comment,0.972,0.01

6777,Sargos,23314141,"&gt;Are you saying the original owner can destroy the token they already gave you?<p>With most tokens, no. They are yours forever. If the token creator did want to set this up then they can do it though. An example is RealT which tokenizes rental housing. They can revoke a token and re-issue it if they need to (if you lose your token or it gets stolen) and they are up front about this. It is very obvious when a token has a backdoor and most of them do not as it&#x27;s kind of a scandal when someone does backdoor a token and people don&#x27;t adopt it.<p>&gt;Regarding social recovery<p>I did cover theft in my comment but I&#x27;ll elaborate. Smart contract wallets are more sophisticated than simply money being stored on a computer. They operate a lot like banks do today with daily spending limits, trusted owners, and the like. With Argent for example you can limit outgoing transfers to non-whitelisted addresses to $100 a day similar to how ATMs are limited in the amount you can withdraw daily. This cuts down on loss due to theft. As soon as you notice $100 missing you would recover your wallet (like replacing your debit card) and the thief wouldn&#x27;t be able to steal anymore. Also, in case you don&#x27;t know the technicals, wallets are generally very secure and even if an extension can see your wallet they won&#x27;t be able to access the funds as they are cryptographically protected and also secured by a password&#x2F;biometrics. So it&#x27;s not likely that your funds will be stolen by a run-of-the-mill thief and even if they are successful the loss is limited.<p>With all that said, a lot of people will likely still use banks to store and use their crypto as those existing trusted intermediaries still work just fine. People just have the option of storing their digital money themselves now.",1590514982,comment,0.9182,0.106

6892,danmostudco,23314256,"I feel Earthbound, the classic SNES RPG where Ness debuted, is a masterclass on NPC dialogue. The dialogue is so well crafted it makes you eager to talk to each NPC you come by, knowing even if they don&#x27;t give you relevant information they will give you a silly hot take on the world they occupy. It makes everything so much more rich. The Rabbit Girl referenced in the article is from Undertale by Toby Fox, who cut his teeth in gamemaking creating Earthbound mods. I suspect this is why his characters in Undertale follow a similar whimsical nature to this early influence of his. Undertale borrowed a lot from Earthbound&#x27;s character construction.<p>I&#x27;ve been playing through Earthbound over the last few weeks and consistently find the writers and localization team put in just the right extra 10% to turn a &quot;bleh&quot; interaction into one you think about for days to come. For example, in a nod to the greedy, one character grumbles about the loan he gave to your family and now he &quot;lives in poverty&quot; - all while standing in the biggest house in the game.<p>Later on, a key item with key information gets shipped to your character via the equivalent of Fedex &quot;Neglected Class.&quot; A rumpled delivery man eventually shows up and tells you &quot;Anyway, he said... well... uh... I forgot. Yep, I forgot... actually I forgot the stuff I was supposed to deliver, too. I think it was some weird machine to make trout-flavored yogurt. Yeah, I forgot it at the desert... I&#x27;m not going back that way, so don&#x27;t ask me to get the package... I mean, it&#x27;s your package, right? So YOU go get it! Go on, get out of here.&quot; You then have to schlep to another part of the game to recover the package the delivery man decided just wasn&#x27;t worth his time [0]<p>If you&#x27;ve played the game and want to figure out why some of the quirkiness just WORKS, I would recommend the later parts of Tim Roger&#x27;s piece from a decade or so ago [1].<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;EIoLcNLyd0g?t=27902"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;EIoLcNLyd0g?t=27902</a><p>[1] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;fMD7F"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;fMD7F</a> (edit - huh, yeah this article has NOT aged well at all I should have taken a closer look since it first was released long ago, but I&#x27;ll leave it here for the sake of discussion &amp; derivative comments).",1590515529,comment,0.8681,0.022

7028,dcolkitt,23314392,"I forget who first made this argument, but it basically was a response to critics of philosophy. Critics would challenge the field by asking if philosophy has made any real contributions to human knowledge. Has it actually discovered anything that&#x27;s both non-obvious and conclusively true?<p>And apologists would that philosophy has made huge, unambiguous contributions. Only once this happens, those fields tend to be no longer considered &quot;philosophy&quot;. Astronomy, physics, economics, and logic were all sub-domains of philosophy originally. Once they were formalized, with rigorous, specialized methods they moved into their own standalone fields. But it was philosophers who laid the foundation. Consequently when we think of &quot;philosophy&quot;, there&#x27;s a lot of selection bias, because it&#x27;s basically the subset of open unsolved problems that remain.<p>I think there&#x27;a a close analogy here with what we think of as generalized &quot;business problems&quot;. There are many specialized sub-fields like finance, logistics, marketing, industrial psychology, and accounting. All of those things used to be thought of as a generic part of business. But eventually domain-specific methods and technologies led to the point where specialized practitioners unambiguously out-performed generalist C-suite executives.<p>Think of techniques like Markowitz portfolio optimization, or five factory personality testing, or applying Benford&#x27;s law to profile for accounting fraud. Those are all examples where something like AI&#x2F;ML solved what at the time was a generic business problem. But afterwards it was now just considered a success of the respective sub-field that those techniques helped create.<p>The point I&#x27;m making is that formal rules-based processes (I won&#x27;t use AI&#x2F;ML here because it&#x27;s so ambiguous, especially in a historical context) have had a long history of success in business.

7041,wtallis,23314405,"Most, <i>but not all</i> of the capacity and affordability increases of SSDs have been due to compromises elsewhere. If you plot the characteristics of &quot;the cheapest flash you can buy&quot; over the years, few of the curves are monotonic.<p>Physical memory cell dimensions decreased steadily until the arrival of 3D NAND, whereupon cell sizes jumped back up and have been relatively stable since. SSDs incorporate more advanced error correction with each generation of controllers, so today&#x27;s drives can get more usable write endurance out of the same physical cell size.<p>Number of bits that can be stored per cell has been increasing. Each time we cram another bit into each memory cell, performance and write endurance drop. But in between those major shifts, successive generations of flash tend to get faster and more energy-efficient over time. Today&#x27;s 3 bit per cell TLC NAND is much faster than the TLC from 5 years ago, and has better write endurance thanks to the transition to 3D NAND. Today&#x27;s SLC NAND has comparable performance and write endurance to the planar SLC that disappeared from the market over 5 years ago, but now it&#x27;s several times cheaper.<p>And most of the compromises that have been made with NAND flash over the past 10+ years are purely academic. The vast majority of use cases do not need flash rated for 100k P&#x2F;E cycles, and excess endurance beyond your needs provides no tangible benefit. Most of the endurance that has theoretically been sacrificed was never needed in the first place. Most of the performance lost has been offset by using more flash in parallel and by eliminating bottlenecks elsewhere.<p>The only metric by which a 5 year old NAS hard drive—or <i>any</i> hard drive—will outperform a modern cheap SSD is in long-term sustained sequential write throughput. Even the slowest modern cheap SSD will offer at least twice the sequential read throughput, and orders of magnitude better random read or write throughput. And it&#x27;s not like the write throughput of modern SSDs is abysmal: gigabit Ethernet is a more significant bottleneck when filling a 1TB or larger dirt-cheap consumer SSD. So unless you&#x27;re trying to use cheap consumer SSDs in an expensive NAS with 10GbE, the poor write performance of low-end SSDs won&#x27;t come into play.",1590516272,comment,0.1851,0.061

This might seem fine since everyone likes Bitcoin and such, but those cryptocurrencies are controlled by the community, not by a central organization. Libra is controlled by a group of major corporations and organizations, not by the community. Meaning that if those corporations decide to do something with the currency, no person or government could stop them.<p>That might not sound too bad. They own platform, so they should be able to control it, right? However, you need to consider that if someone controls the economy of a country, they control the government of that country as well. They would be able to control inflation and therefore the boom&#x2F;bust cycle. If Libra is used by the majority of citizens and businesses in a country, then the group of corporations ruling Libra will be able to manipulate that country&#x27;s government to do their bidding.

You have to compare the intuitions directly to each other to see that in one case you&#x27;re adding parts of the same whole (set or group or table of kids) and in another case adding the wholes.<p>From what I know of elementary school, we focus a lot on fractions and the formal manipulation of them as unitless values, and drill into kids that 2&#x2F;4, 1&#x2F;2, and 0.5 are all &quot;the same thing&quot;. Bullshit! It&#x27;s no wonder they have problems with word problems! Two-out-of-four apples and one-out-of-two apples and a half apple are very different things, as every elementary student knows well.

We&#x27;ve now found a perfectly intuitive meaning of addition for which our standard &quot;+&quot; definition does not fit! This gives an opportunity to explore the connections between mathematics and intuition and the symbols and the real world operations they stand for. It gives us an excellent chance to, as Polya puts it, &quot;introduce a suitable notation&quot; for the setwise addition of &quot;marked&quot; sets that we have just discovered. Then we can explore the properties of this operation and the ones between it and the familiar addition operation. We can show that the plus sign and the addition operation we use it to represent are distinct, and our use of one for the other is a choice, and one we could make differently.<p>I saw some mentions of units in the comments, and yet 1&#x2F;3 + 1&#x2F;3 = ? is still ill-defined if we know only that &quot;1&#x2F;3&quot; means &quot;one out of three students&quot;. What we need to know is which students they are! So if one out of Alice, Bob, and Charlie has red hair, and one out of Charlie, Doris, and Evan has red hair, how many of Alice, Bob, Charlie, Doris, and Evan have red hair? Well, we made the question challenging even for adults if we ask it that way! And now you can introduce uncertainty and degrees of belief. (What if three people tell you they have one red-headed friend, in a class of 23 students? Do they all have the same friend, or is there more than one redhead?)<p>Of course what most of us will actually do as the teacher in this situation is freeze and think &quot;oh no, I&#x27;ve made a mistake and the teacher (in your mind) is going to point it out and the class is going to laugh at me!&quot;. Because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve learned happens in these situations. If we interpret confusion and being wrong as painful and embarrassing, little wonder that mathematics seems a long and painful road that we avoid whenever we can.",1590516532,comment,-0.6572,0.078

While there are a number of group chat apps available to users today, what makes CatchUp unique is that the calls it enables are audio-only, not video, and it flags when users are available. In addition, CatchUp won’t need a Facebook account to use the service — the app works with your phone’s contacts list.<p>&#x27;CatchUp does seem to take some inspiration from Houseparty, in that users in CatchUp can designate when they’re available to talk by setting their status in the app. This is similar to how Houseparty’s video chat app also lets you see who’s live, by sending out notifications when friends open the app and flagging them as “here” in the app’s interface.&#x27;<p>Original title was too long.

7155,corty,23314519,"&gt; Is there a legitimate reason for some network appliance with any form of persistent storage that you can write to once or more to use different DUIDs through its lifetime?<p>Even the operating systems, with persistent storage in the form of harddisks get this wrong: a DUID is reassigned on every reinstall, at least. MAC addresses are convenient since they are basically global serial numbers in the form of ROM, fuses or similar. Only later were MAC addresses generated on the device by a RNG. There is just no hope for the DUID situation to ever get better, meaning DHCPv6 will never get useful.<p>&gt; Of course if there is little benefit to you, replacing your existing infrastructure and processes is going to be a high relative cost. This is true of any new technology<p>No, it isn&#x27;t. There are technologies that are designed to be easy to migrate to newer versions. Usually one doesn&#x27;t notice those, because of the lack of problems. E.g. going from Ethernet to WiFi is relatively simple because of the intentional huge similarities. Upgrading a HTTP server from 1.0 to 1.1 to 2 doesn&#x27;t change a lot in your processes, although there are huge differences especially from 1.1 to 2. TLS 1.3 looks completely different from 1.2 on a protocol level, but it was designed with upgrades in mind. To an admin or end user, it is practically the same.<p>Other technologies, e.g. POP3 vs. IMAP or cloud-based vs. physical computing can easily run side-by-side.<p>IPv6 is lacking in both methods of migration. You can&#x27;t transparently upgrade (which would be hard to accomplish because of the different addresses). And you can&#x27;t run it side-by-side easily, because of problems like the lacking DHCPv4&#x2F;DHCPv6 correspondence.

7283,dmitrygr,23314647,"I&#x27;ve been there at Google a few times and can imagine exactly how this went :&#x2F;. The one time I can tell about is the blogger disaster [1]. The top leadership, spearheaded by chief of legal was basically ignoring everyone&#x27;s logical arguments at the meetings, the town halls, etc. We kept coming to the mic and telling them that their ideas of what is and isn&#x27;t sexual are arbitrary, as are anyone else&#x27;s. They said &quot;no, we have experts and we have a clear definition&quot; (they didn&#x27;t). We explained that post-facto removing content people wrote is cruel and unnecessary. They claimed &quot;nobody would care or miss it&quot;. (of course they would). We told them that this will hurt transgender people, who used to find support in blogs of others going through the same life challenges and blogging about it. Those blogs would be banned under the policy. They said they had data that impact would be minimal. (They had no data). Normal rank-and-file people at google all knew the idea was a bad one. We fought hard. They scheduled a 8-am townhall and announced it the day before at 9pm! We showed up anyways en masse! There was a line to the microphone!<p>They had microphones in the audience. I walked up and directly asked for the &quot;data&quot; they claimed to have showing no impact will be had. They claimed and I quote &quot;we have no hardcore data&quot; (audience was laughing at the word choice given the topic). I said that &quot;well, then how can you claim to be making a data-driven decision?&quot; Drummond answered that &quot;we know this is right and we are sure.&quot; The town hall was a waste of time. Nothing we said was <i>heard</i> and all they did was recite lines at us from the stage that made it look like either they did not understand what we had to say, or they were trying very hard to appear to not understand. Both sides were talking, but nothing we said seemed to change their mind, They came there to deliver a policy, not to collect feedback on it, despite claiming this was a meeting to <i>discuss</i> it. That was clear.<p>We did not give up. Google&#x27;s TGIF was the next day. A number of people came there early and lined up and the microphones, ready to bring this up again and again. In front of the whole company and the CEO as well (Larry and Sergey were not at the town hall and claimed to have not heard of the policy until &quot;the ruckus started&quot;).<p>I guess they saw the large line of people and relented. Before the scheduled TGIF began they announced they will reverse the policy.<p>This was a rare victory, for this sort of a situation. I am willing to bet that there are <i>lots</i> of good people at facebook who also fought as hard or harder against this. They just probably lost.

When asked what they wanted to do with the money, it wasn&#x27;t uncommon to hear they wanted to setup&#x2F;update their website and online presence.<p>To me, that sounded absurd at the time. I&#x27;d be thinking in my head, they could setup a WordPress site in a couple of days, or grab some off-the-shelf shopping cart software and have it done for 1k. If they wanted something more customized, they could probably find a developer to do everything for less than 5k.<p>Then I realized they&#x27;re a very small business, they&#x27;re doing a million a year in sales, and their new site would be one of the most important aspects of their business that would directly impact their sales and how their business is perceived. 100k to set that up suddenly seemed very fair and reasonable. The outcome of that site could make or break their business. Why on earth would they only invest a few thousand into such a thing?<p>Or think about any small business with a dozen employees. They&#x27;re spending a million a year on payroll. Is redeveloping their entire online identity and user experience worth a one time 100k expense? I think so.<p>Also, if you charge enough you can start bringing in outside help. For example, you&#x27;re a programmer, but they also need a logo refresh on the project. If you&#x27;re charging 100k, you can easily budget to bring in a designer that focuses on brand identity. You&#x27;ll end up with higher quality work for your client, a better portfolio for your business, and in the future that&#x27;ll allow you to quote higher rates. You can step back a bit into management and take on more work since you&#x27;re not personally doing everything.<p>In short, recognize the value you&#x27;re bringing to a business. Working closely with them over 6 months and building out a solution that helps them grow, reduces their headaches, streamlines their existing processes, and increase their revenue is very much worth 100k.

7337,Sargos,23314701,"&gt;What is the point of a token if its actually centrally controlled like rental properties?<p>This goes down the rabbit hole of crypto a bit and I don&#x27;t want to drone on too much if it gets annoying, sorry in advance.<p>Most tokens will not be centrally controlled in the future (I can elaborate if you&#x27;re interested). During the transition period there will be centralized tokens like RealT which have similar properties to the paper forms we use today but even in that state they do offer improvements such as integration with DeFi products (RealT tokens can traded on Uniswap and will likely be integrated into Maker allowing for using your property shares in a collatorized loan), easier accountability&#x2F;auditability, and other use cases (Let&#x27;s go a bit sci-fi and say your car lock will open for you as long as you prove you own the car&#x27;s ERC-721).<p>&gt;Presumably those spending limits and indeed ANY limits are user configurable with a token that could itself be stolen or just used by software instead of a person on the machine in question.<p>This stuff does exist and there&#x27;s some really good documentation out there that&#x27;s not just me rambling :) Changing or turning off the spending limits or whitelists comes with a user-defined waiting period, so even if a virus somehow accomplishes this feat you would still be notified and have a day or so to cancel the changes and recover your wallet. Your original example was a browser extension which cannot fake keyboard or mouse input to your wallet. It would need to be a real virus of some kind which is rare on desktops in today&#x27;s world and basically impossible on mobile platforms. I&#x27;m not saying the risk is 0% but it&#x27;s not like mass numbers of people are going to just get their crypto stolen willy nilly, especially if they use their phones like the majority of the people in the world do.<p>&gt;Credit card transactions are tolerable because the financial sector takes in a huge chunk of the value of the economy and writes off losses out of that huge pile of money.<p>Credit cards will still exist in a crypto world. Banks will still exist too. You will be able to reverse those payments just like you can today even if the credit card company backs their operations with ETH&#x2F;DAI&#x2F;BTC instead of USD. On top of that, it&#x27;s actually really easy to develop a payment system on top of Ethereum that contains the ability to reverse transactions for a period of time with complex logic such as different amounts of time for different merchants based on a calculated risk score.

Imagine being able to directly recombine these features, generating a new set of recommendations dynamically. Almost all recommendation engines fail in this regard—the model feeds the user exactly what the model (designer) wants, no more and no less.<p>- <i>Encourage serendipity</i>: i.e. purposefully select and recommend items that the model “thinks” is outside the user’s wheelhouse (wheelhouse = whatever naturally emerging cluster(s) in the data that the user hangs out in, so pluck out examples from both nearby and distant clusters).

Earlier, the network had sent letters to several American pro-Israel organisations informing them that their employees would appear in the documentary. These letters generated speculation that the Qatari government had reneged on its earlier promise to block Al Jazeera from screening the controversial documentary which, like the earlier British series, had utilized clandestine footage and recordings of pro-Israel activists.&quot;

Show some percentage of your users an increased level of posts from the opposite party, some others an increased level of posts from their own party, and leave the remaining 90% alone. After running that for a month or two, see which of those groups is doing better.<p>They&#x27;ve clearly got something interesting and possibly important, but &#x27;interaction strength&#x27; is not intrinsically good or bad. I would instead ask the researcher to pivot from a metric of &quot;interaction strength&quot; to something more closely aligned to the value the user derives from their use of your product.  (Side note: Hopefully, use of your product adds value for your users. If your users are better off the less they use their platform, that&#x27;s a serious problem).<p>Do people interacting with posts from the opposite party come away more empathetic and enlightened? If they are predominantly shown posts from their own party, does an echo chamber develop where they become increasingly radicalized? Does frequent exposure to viewpoints they disagree with make people depressed? They&#x27;ll eventually become aware outside of the discussion board of what the opposite party is doing, does early exposure to those posts make them more accepting, or does it make them angry and surprised?   Perhaps people become fatigued after writing a couple angry diatribes (or the original poster becomes depressed after reading that angry diatribe) and people quit your platform.<p>Unfortunately, checking interaction strength through comment word counts is easy, while sentiment analysis is really hard. Whether doing in-person psych evals or broadly analyzing the users&#x27; activity feed for life successes or for depression, you&#x27;ll have tons of noise, because very little of those effects will come from your discussion board.

The text does not flow well at all.<p>If you only have line breaks at the end of paragraphs the text might flow better but the default viewport width on mobile browsers is (usually) 980px. Desktop browsers set their viewport width to the window width. In either case text ends up hard to read because lines end up really long.<p>You also lose hyperlinking which makes the web...a web.<p>If you want a plain text website just make it HTML with a minimal or no stylesheet. A single viewport meta tag will keep the page readable everywhere. Setting it to the device width will make mobile browsers reflow the text based on the screen size.<p>No one is going to read your blog with netcat or just curl into a pager.,1590518706,comment,-0.7519,0.087

But not the adventures I managed to have by meeting people in all different types of jobs. And there&#x27;s something about physical labor that calms me. Sitting at a desk all day seems so antithetical to actually living a life out in the real world and feeling the earth between your toes, the sun and wind on your body while taking in the green things around you!<p>I was dumpster diving and taking stepper motors out of dot matrix printers in the early 90s down on Wall street while working a 12 to 9 shift taking care of a VAX&#x2F;VMS and Banyan Vines PC network for an environmental law firm. I used to write reports in Paradox, work on Concordance - a document management system - BRS search routines and queries. I used the steppers for my amateur robotics influenced by Rodney Brooks&#x27; subsumption architecture and Mark Tilden&#x27;s BEAM stuff. I played Doom for the first time at that job!<p>I was an art handler (Brooklyn Museum), paintings conservator&#x27;s assistant, 3D FX and animation on SGI intern using Prisms (now Houdini) at a NYC Ad agency&#x2F;FX company, welder, machinist, CNC coder, technical diver and ropework technician (think IRATA&#x2F;SPRAT), among the memorable items. I remember being one of the early funders for getting Blender3D open sourced way back when (2001&#x2F;02), and writing a Python script to turn photos into wooden carvings back in 2002&#x2F;03 with it on my CNC table. The software was based upon a paper by NASA about &#x27;Shape from Shading&#x27;. it alsow churned out G-code for our table after downloading the client&#x27;s file, and gave me an estimate of machine time and overall cost. This is before 3D printers, and tables used to be in the 6 figures, but this was an $8k 4 ft x 8 ft router table. My partner and I used it to cut out kayak designs we made out of 4 mm Okume plywood and the carvings I did in solid maple in bas relief. We did some urns for pets and pet cemeteries (really! <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thewoodenimage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thewoodenimage.com</a>. Used to come up on the Wayback Machine without pics or other content). Sad to say, people loved our carvings at boat shows, etc., but nobody bought them. We had crowds at our table, but not a single purchase. Funny cemeteries were our market, and a gentlemen offered me money for the software to make bronze tombstone plaques from family photos!<p>I worked at a company as a sys admin, and did some coding in C, C#, Java, but mainly my strength was writing front ends for old Italian sheet metal punch machines and translating modern G-code into the &#x27;Octo&#x27; machines&#x27; proprietary code. This was in C. Putting a temperature sensor in the server room, and have it ping a pager of me and the other sys admins.<p>I did Christmas display window animations for a display company in NYC as a welder and later as the head of their creative technologies. One Christmas (1996-7?). We had pneumatically operated 4 to 5 ft high Nutcrackers whose arms would go up with a bell in it if a child touched the window where there were five large buttons painted on the back of the window with a capacitive sensor behind it, a BasicStamp (think today&#x27;s Arduino) running it, queuing the music and triggering the pneumatic valves. Remember right up until this, the internet and information from companies was not as accessible. I had to write letters, emails, and phone call for weeks.<p>I will probably never retire. I just put a deposit down on a live&#x2F;work space to use my desktop cnc mill&#x2F;lathe, 3D printer and electronics equipment (a CNC sewing&#x2F;embroidery machine too).<p>I currently work at an engineering firm that specializes in stage machinery and anything entertainment-related. Because I don&#x27;t code full-time for a living, I code up things in what works best for me and the company I work for. I write them in C, python, factor, J, forth, assembler (micros), and I play with a lot more PLs (Zig, Rust, Haskell, R&#x2F;RStudio), but I am mainly sticking with C and J for now with Zig as a cross compiler. I avoid python, not because it isn&#x27;t good or I don&#x27;t like it, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in with my preference for terseness and shedding bloat. I am having a renewed interest in C and assembler. I am getting older for some of the more physical work I did, so I am now coding more to try and see if I can make something of it.<p>I was working in Macau for 6-plus years for the The House of Dancing Water show up until the end of 2015.

This startup is talking about applying engineering to influence human behavior in order to make people use their product more, presumably because their monetization strategy sells that attention or the data generated by it.<p>If I were the PM I’d suggest a change in business model to something that aligns the best interests of users with the best interests of the company.<p>I’d stop measuring “engagement” or algorithmically favoring posts that people interact with more. I’d have a conversation with my users about what they want to get out of the platform that lasts longer than the split second decision to click one thing and not another. And I’d prepare to spend massive resources on moderation to ensure that my users aren’t being manipulated by others now that my company has stopped manipulating them.<p>I think the issues of showing content from one side of a political divide or the other is much less important than showing material from trustworthy sources. The deeper issue, which is a very hard problem to solve, is dealing with the fundamental asymmetries that come up in political discourse. In the US, if you were to block misinformation and propaganda you’d disproportionately be blocking right wing material. How do you convince users to value truth and integrity even if their political leaders don’t, and how do you as a platform value them even if that means some audiences will reject you?<p>I don’t know how to answer those questions but they do start to imply that maybe “news + commenting as a place to spend lots of time” isn’t the best place to expend energy if you’re trying to make things better?",1590518950,comment,0.9603,0.058

7767,JadeNB,23315131,"&gt; Multiplication is a composition of addition, and addition is a composition of the successor function. The successor function is not a composition of anything, but you can define it in terms of set theory if you don&#x27;t want to simply accept it as a primitive. But sets are functions too.<p>&gt; the point I was trying to make, which is that infix notation is a Really Bad Idea<p>Not to be snarky, but, reading these two (from your two thread-successive posts <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23312725"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23312725</a> and <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23314776"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23314776</a>) in succession, I still can&#x27;t see anything about the first one that indicates the point that infix notation is a bad idea.  Not that I&#x27;m disagreeing with the point, just that I can&#x27;t find it in the first post.  Could you clarify the connection?<p>&gt; What is successor a composition of?<p>It&#x27;s a composition of, for example, itself and the identity function, like everything else; or you could view it as a composition (-1) . (+2).  Those kind of silly solutions are why I thought you meant &#x27;iteration&#x27;.<p>Iterative solutions are easy if you don&#x27;t restrict yourself to natural numbers—for example, (+1) is (+(1&#x2F;2)) composed with itself—but that&#x27;s clearly not what you meant.  (As soon as you leave the natural numbers, even the idea that addition is iterated successor becomes false.)<p>If you do so restrict yourself, <i>then</i> it becomes true that the successor is not a non-trivial iterate.  (I just skated the edge of claiming the opposite in my post, but avoided error by not specifying what domain I meant.  That&#x27;s just luck, though; I meant a particular thing, and I was wrong.  To prove it, supposing you start your natural numbers at 0 and that f is a function such that f^{\circ k} is the successor function for some k &gt; 1, then note that f is injective (because a composition power is).  If f(0) = 0, then succ(0) = f(f(0)) = f(0) = 0, which is a contradiction.  Put n = f(0) and note that f^{\circ n k}(0) = succ^n(0) = n, but n k &gt; 1.)<p>By the way, you quoted (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23314776"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23314776</a>):<p>&gt; &gt; you meant the more specific term<p>Just to be clear, what I said (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23314530"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23314530</a>) was &quot;I <i>think</i> you meant the more specific term&quot;.

You can only put the ones you encounter back into the sea. It doesn’t solve the problem as a whole, but it makes a difference to the ones you’re able to save.<p>Or, from a Judeo-Christian perspective; “If among you, one of your brothers should become poor, in any of your towns within your land that the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother, but you shall open your hand to him and lend him sufficient for his need, whatever it may be … For the poor you will always have with you in the land. Therefore I command you, ‘You shall open wide your hand to your brother, to the needy and to the poor, in your land.” (Deuteronomy 15:7-11)<p>I take this to mean that helping those who need help is the responsibility of every individual, within that individual’s means. I also take it to mean that it is a problem where one should not expect a neat resolution; no matter how much you give or how many people give alongside you, there will always be more that can (and should) be done.

In that case I wasn’t even able to help them pay for groceries due to my own financial situation... but months later, that same person flagged me down and told me - with tears in their eyes - that the fact that I took the time to help them was a major factor in their deciding not to attempt suicide and to seek help.

7924,zackmorris,23315288,"A few ideas off the top of my head. Note that I mostly work on the backend, so my frontend knowledge is at least 5 years out of date. My terms might be wrong, but I think the concepts align closely with how I projected the web would work back in 1995 when I first saw it. Pretty much everything has gone the opposite direction though, and we’ve recreated all of the pitfalls of desktop programming on the web.<p>- A one-shot, partially Turing complete scripting language would be nice. We should be able to include external scripts, position elements, perform basic computation, and then have a guarantee that the script has finished and will no longer run and use resources. Javascript is fine, but the user would have to give permission for it to run setTimeout(), setInterval() and similar ongoing operations. Discussion needed about scripts running post-load, like for clicks are keeping elements positioned (possibly a user-settable instruction, memory or time limit).<p>- I&#x27;d vote to largely retire frontend model-view-control (MVC) patterns. The browser is already the view, so I find most of the approaches introduced by frameworks like Angular.js to be at the very least superfluous, but potentially misguided or even hazardous. See Intercooler.js for declarative alternatives to what we have now.<p>- Instead of hand-rolled scripted pages, browsers need a basic component or window metaphor, in which all GUI elements descend from a base element, can be nested, and have a full life cycle that can be customized at each step. The user would have to give permission to override builtin elements like &lt;body&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, etc, but elements could descend from them with overrides. Discussion is needed about security. For what it&#x27;s worth, I just don&#x27;t think that the various approaches to building components have panned out. I feel like there is a common abstraction here behind things like React that could be generalized.<p>- On that note, the way we include remote resources on the web is broken. We need a way to choose whether the HTML for a component is written in-place, or as a URL (or other address) that includes the remote definition. Similar to if inline data: base64 images correspond to our current markup, then we could replace a block of text with an href to allow reuse. Like &lt;div href=“example.com&#x2F;mydiv.html”&gt;, and mydiv.html would hold &lt;div&gt;something&lt;span&gt;something&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; or whatever. See server side includes (SSI) for an early failed example of this.<p>- Individual requests need to go away and be replaced by a content-addressable caching system where the hash is the address, so we can go back to including individual global sources of truth for things like jQuery or Bootstrap files, rather than maintaining copies of those includes on our own server. See subresource integrity (SRI) as a starting point.<p>- It may be time to scrap build systems. I&#x27;d like to see the world take a step back, and consider architecting a web where more protocols and formats like UDP or Markdown &quot;just work&quot; and don&#x27;t need to be transpiled to whatever brittle&#x2F;proprietary-infested conventions are available. Think of this as how compilers can provide generators by altering the code to work in runtimes that don’t have generators. That concept could be extended to everything, so that the server&#x2F;browser is able to provide features that aren’t yet mainstream, by perhaps running portions of our build pipelines directly under the hood. Basically a turing complete language should be able to run anything, but right now we have wide swaths of computer science blocked to us for security and other reasons, but usually because a proprietary player like Microsoft doesn’t want to implement something. We should be able to run Firefox within Edge, conceptually. And figure out what fundamental capabilities must be provided to allow for something so general. It could be as basic as a general-purpose sandbox where the user decides which system calls and data to allow the executables running inside to access.<p>- Let&#x27;s talk about how to remove undefined and optional rules from the major RFCs and specifications. As an analogy, much of the optional functionality in OpenGL caused the renderer to fall off the fast path back to the software renderer. But since performance is a feature in OpenGL, dancing around optionals caused an explosion in implementation complexity. Today many thousands of developers reinvent the wheel countless times because someone decided way back when to limit video card programming to SIMD (thus barring conceptually simple techniques like ray tracing). A better way would be to have general-purpose computing so we could go back to some kind of cluster programming in languages like Erlang and Go, but I digress. A similar thing needs to happen with the web, where the underlying implementation would be general-purpose and open source (to virtually guarantee that all options are implemented) then we could pick and choose which ones to disable due to security concerns or whatnot.<p>- The semantic web is unlikely to ever happen, but, resource description framework (RDF) triples and concepts like hyperlinks pointing back to the caller could&#x2F;should happen first. This needs to be done by the server or browser in an automated way 100% if possible. Content-addressable links might partially fix this. Basically the gap between raw HTML and the metadata that search engines and advertisers store needs to be formalized. Think of this as taking HEAD requests, REST API descriptions in things like Swagger, and any other information gleaned by spiders or AIs, and making that readily accessible for any page. So when we go on something like eBay, we could look at the page outline and detect any tabular date, contact information, form actions, etc etc and be able to manipulate that page metadata the way we currently examine things like an element&#x27;s styling.<p>- A prerequisite to the above is to be able to download portions of websites or the entire web as a directed graph, and to do that, we need to be able to query the web in something like SQL, only without a search engine. So to use the eBay example, if I had this then I could find my dream car by searching and cross referencing against things like performance, fuel economy, warranty, and so on. The way we might manipulate such data in Excel or a SQL database. Another way to say this is that most sites would lose their search field, and the browser would see the site as a gist or index describing the graph, with common actions suggested, provided by the community of previous searchers. See Neo4j for how something like this might look in practice.<p>- It’s time to talk about retiring the app as a separate concept from a website. No single metric like performance, device accessibility or ease of use exists as a hard limitation, or justifies developers having to maintain 2+ sets of code and get mired in cross-platform development. A path forward here is to provide funding for game developers and other performance-oriented developers to revamp browser rendering engines to run at many thousands of frames per second instead of the glacial pace they crawl now. For example, the DOM diffing of React should have already existed as a feature of early HTML renderers. We need to be looking at things like forking and copy-on-write to enhance the performance of web pages that share the vast majority of their content. There are also streaming techniques that would let browsers access media as memory-mapped data rather than loading files into memory. Browsers could be as powerful as they are now, but run in something like 16 MB of ram rather than GBs, and always react instantly rather than having multi-second delays when many tabs are open.<p>Well that’s 10. I know there are many, many more things I would like to see but maybe this isn’t the best forum for this. I’m temporarily retired from programming after going through the worst burnout of my life last year. All I see around me are these disjunctions between what the world is and what it could be, so it feels like in order to work anymore, I would have to go back to basics and rewrite most stuff from the ground up. That’s with all of tech, not any one area. So I just concentrate on the things I can control, like making rent, getting my car fixed, staying in touch with relatives, etc. Tech is just too much of a time suck for me to justify anymore, when all of the capital has been vacuumed up by a handful of large players that don’t care about this stuff, to the point where winning the internet lottery with a startup is about as likely as being in the NBA.",1590520529,comment,0.9989,0.026

a) Find an interesting conjecture that you&#x27;ve got a strong guess to be true.
b) Check for obvious (or less obvious) counterexamples, or conflicting theorems.
c) Prove the thing is true.<p>A large part of the art of being a working mathematician is in part (a): you need to make a really good guess. An ideal conjecture is correct AND proveable AND leads to other interesting results, or says interesting things about bigger problems.<p>So what happens when we apply really good versions of current AI to this area? Picking out an &#x27;interesting&#x27; conjecture is still Strong-AI-Complete: it requires lots of domain knowledge, and an understanding of what this particular conjecture would &#x27;unlock.&#x27; But we could perhaps come up with good &#x27;guessers&#x27; which quickly tell us whether a given idea might work out, perhaps saving a bunch of effort.

On the internet though, it is a reality for many people (especially women) that there are no consequences for such horrible language and communication.

Those approaches are equivalent in power, the difference is only that neural networks are more amenable to parallelization and we know a very good baseline optimization algorithm (gradient descent and friends).<p>The problem is that coming up with an optimizer&#x2F;architecturer is hard. So the benefit of running a meta-optimizer to solve a problem is difficult to realize versus a handmade neural network. The problem needs to be so large the network would need to re-engineer itself to solve it -- but think how many resources have already been spent in engineering neural networks (by humans no less, which are quite powerful optimizers!). Unless the problem is truly titanic (w.r.t. other current problems) the yields might be small.<p>What you can do in a similar vein is gather a large set of problems and train a &#x27;Neural architect&#x27; or something like that that then can be applied many times to new problems. This allows sharing this cost over many new networks. I think it could make sense for governments and large organizations to get together and create this sort of thing.  If you know the costs of training a large neural network, imagine the cost of training hundreds of millions to train some kind of neural architect (NA).<p>There are milder versions of this, where the architecture search itself isn&#x27;t trained:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neural_architecture_search"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neural_architecture_search</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automated_machine_learning"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automated_machine_learning</a><p>Of course even this approach has limitations (even if you theoretically allow it to create essentially arbitrary architectures), because it will still have difficulty &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; like we do using huge amounts of mathematical expertise and intuition (see EfficientNet -- the insight in that paper would be difficult to arise from a NA network) -- it&#x27;s not the thing that will solve all of our problem forever; but it would be pretty significant (perhaps towards making large AI-based systems with multiple components, say self-driving cars and robots of the future).",1590521881,comment,0.9362,0.094

When Minsky et al set out to define AI what they really meant was &#x27;thinking machines&#x27;.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s two word senses, the theoretical and the colloquial.  You&#x27;re referring to the former, and I&#x27;m referring to the latter; the latter is a lot more relevant to this thread&#x27;s topic, which is public perception of AI and its value.  Wikipedia actually has a pretty good concise description of these two senses:<p>&gt; Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of &quot;intelligent agents&quot;: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[1] Colloquially, the term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic &quot;cognitive&quot; functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;problem solving&quot;[2]<p>(The [2] citation is of Russell &amp; Norvig&#x27;s &#x27;09 edition, substantially predating the recent mass-interest in AI)<p>&gt;  if that&#x27;s intelligence my smart-toaster is probably more intelligent than everyone here together<p>The leap from &quot;this is reasonably described as a step on the road to intelligence&quot; to &quot;being really good at this step means you&#x27;re _really_ intelligent&quot; is obviously nonsense, though I suspect you know that.

Every time you try something to fix your life and you fail, you actually make a little bit of progress on yourself, just not enough to switch your behavior into something recognizably better. When you try a new strategy and succeed, there is a strong chance that you would not have been successful had you not made all of that incremental progress on yourself from all your failures.

What happened?
You&#x27;ve requested a page on a website (archive.md) that is on the Cloudflare network. Cloudflare is currently unable to resolve your requested domain (archive.md). There are two potential causes of this:<p>Most likely: if the owner just signed up for Cloudflare it can take a few minutes for the website&#x27;s information to be distributed to our global network.
Less likely: something is wrong with this site&#x27;s configuration. Usually this happens when accounts have been signed up with a partner organization (e.g., a hosting provider) and the provider&#x27;s DNS fails.
Cloudflare Ray ID: 599a073ddbc3ae0c • Your IP: <i>.</i>.<i>.</i> • Performance &amp; security by Cloudflare
&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>This raises more questions:<p><pre><code>  - Why doesn&#x27;t Cloudflare just return NXDOMAIN if it thinks the domain doesn&#x27;t exist, rather than resolving to a bogus server?

  - Why doesn&#x27;t it just drop and time out the request, so my computer decides to fall back to an alternate DNS resolver?

  - Why doesn&#x27;t it show that error text when a path is present, instead of just serving a HTTP 403 Forbidden error with no additional information.</code></pre>",1590522920,comment,-0.933,0.107

High cardinality categorical features aren&#x27;t what makes this hard.  Re-engineering the business processes aren&#x27;t what makes this hard.<p>What makes this hard, is that for all of these companies, machine learning models are essentially used in place of heuristics of varying degrees of complexity.  The models are being used to incrementally improve heuristics that in some cases are tuned quite well.  Couple that with the issue that a machine learning model is only one piece of an actual product improvement for these websites&#x2F;companies (ie: now you have a prediction, what are you gonna do with it to effect the product?), and all of the sudden you have actual incremental improvements completely misaligned with moonshot expectations.<p>We&#x27;ve had plenty of rankers and recommenders for decades, the current wave of deep learning variants are improvements, but they&#x27;re incremental from a high level.

Alternative medicine refers to therapeutic approaches taken in place of traditional medicine and used to treat or ameliorate disease.<p>The difference (as I&#x27;ve understood it anyway) is &quot;alternative medicine&quot; implies you contradict modern medical practices, which was the basis for the comment I replied to.

8519,DiogenesKynikos,23315883,"Hang on a second there. We really have to go back to the history of Nortel, because the claim that Chinese hacking brought down Nortel really does not hold up.<p>Nortel expanded massively during the dot-com bubble, and went on a nearly $20 billion acquisition spree that caused it to lose money every quarter for years, even while its stock price was driven up by unrealistic expectations. Then the dot-com bubble burst, at which point these expectations were tempered and people began worrying about Nortel&#x27;s unprofitability. The stock crashed, raising capital became difficult, demand for Nortel&#x27;s products (and all telecommunications hardware) plummeted, and the company had to lay off 20% of its workers. At this time, Huawei was a tiny player outside of China. Nortel&#x27;s major competitor was Cisco.<p>In 2003, for the first time in years, Nortel finally posted a quarterly profit, but then came under investigation from the SEC over suspicions that it was fudging its numbers (specifically, the accusation was that executives shifted revenue in time in order to meet targets that earned them bonuses). The SEC charged top Nortel executives with fraud, and the case was eventually settled, but Nortel had to change out its top management. Nortel was also sued by shareholders, to whom it had to pay billions of dollars in a settlement. There were layoffs and downsizing throughout this entire period.<p>To look at that history, and then to claim that hacking that might have helped one of Nortel&#x27;s several competitors (and not even the largest, by a long shot) is the reason for Nortel&#x27;s demise just seems completely out of left field to me. To be honest, it sounds like a batter yelling at the ump about being distracted by a fan after he strikes out 0-3.",1590523995,comment,-0.4118,0.085

8522,thephyber,23315886,"I&#x27;m not sure I agree that it&#x27;s the responsibility of the people doing research to protect against foreign nation state attacks (whether cyber or legacy intelligence).<p>1st: most people outside of government don&#x27;t know how much they are expected&#x2F;&quot;required&quot; to do to protect their work against foreign nation states. Except for heavily regulated sectors (government, military, heavy industry, banking, core telecom, and more recently elections) very few companies will actually get help from 3-letter-agencies to actively protect against foreign nation state attacks.<p>2nd: <i>many</i> people expect that the {NSA, Cyber Command, et al} are actively defending <i>all</i> US organizations. I don&#x27;t see evidence of this (although if there was evidence, I probably wouldn&#x27;t see it anyway).<p>3rd: In a national emergency (which the COVID response was declared), there are limits to the liabilities which would otherwise be enforceable in court. There are frequently&#x2F;always legal escape clauses like <i>force majeure</i> and <i>act of god</i> which would likely alleviate liabilities due to fallout from acts of war or a severe pandemic, so it&#x27;s not clear that those &quot;nasty liabilities&quot; could be enforced. There are currently 2 important cyberinsurance cases[1] which are winding their way through courts right now which may effectively decide if cyberinsurance is a viable product (depending on whether). Violations of HIPAA are possible, but similarly may not amount to much in terms of prosecution because of the pandemic.<p>In reality, it&#x27;s damn near impossible to protect against a motivated+targeted nation state attack (especially with the resources of PRC). If the liabilities incentives require all projects (large and small) be able to withstand nation-state attacks, then all of the project resources go to cybersecurity and none into research -- your productivity is now zero.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that it&#x27;s the FBI&#x27;s job to do counter-intel. If a medical research group is defrauded by PRC spies and you blame the researchers for not being able to spot a non-trivial espionage attempt, you are just victim blaming.

It&#x27;s based on a portable Motorola 6800 microprocessor, so the PDP-11 connection is unclear. A coaxial cable is placed up to the detonation point, and as the shock front progresses the cable is crushed, reflecting the TDR pulse back from that point. They call it &quot;Radar on a wire&quot;. The interval between pulses is between 20 and 90 microseconds, so this is much faster than the alleged PDP-11 network card. The original system was developed in 1975 and evolved to the 6800-based system.

Misinformation and propaganda are rampant on their platforms definitely, and echo chambers that reinforce divisive worldviews have probably deepened real societal divisions, but how do you actually implement a policy to stop this? What is &quot;propaganda&quot;? What is &quot;misinformation&quot;? The entire core of Facebook&#x27;s existence is advertising, which means user engagement and reach is the only thing that drives your bottom line; they <i>want</i> to drive users to Facebook and keep them there, and keep them engaged. They&#x27;ve just happened to discover a universal human truth along the way, which is that people <i>like</i> feeling validated, and people <i>like</i> being a member of a tribe. Facebook is the way it is because thats what users <i>want</i>, whether they will admit to it or not.<p>Anything that Facebook does will be perceived as making a political and&#x2F;or moral statement, which they obviously are trying very hard not to do, because as soon as you take a position you alienate half of the population (at least in the US). They&#x27;ve apparently decided to go the route of burying their heads in the sand instead of <i>trying</i> to make things less tribal and divisive, which in all honesty is a pretty understandable position to take, and yet <i>even while actively trying not to piss off conservatives</i> they have still landed in hot water over perceived favoritism towards the left.

8633,crocodiletears,23315997,"They&#x27;re indicative of a collapse of consensus on the part of society. It could well be argued that prior to our current political era, especially in the US, that the political domain was largely constrained to a discourse on cultural aesthetics, wherein the Democrats and and Republicans argued over trivialities (on a broader national, not individual respect) such as abortion, marriage, and immigration, while they operated on an implicit consensus concerning foreign policy, and had a functional stalemate in terms of the size of the state, farming out many of their policy decisions to thinktanks, corporate donors, and well-established bureaucrats within our regulatory bodies<p>America&#x27;s role as international security guarantor, its trade policies, and its government&#x27;s role in domestic affairs was never really up for debate, and it only really changed stepwise in a stochastic manner, responding to situations and incentives day-by-day with no conscious consideration to the role of America or its state on a broader scale.<p>What we&#x27;re seeing now, is large portions of the population coming to realize that that existing bipartian components of the political consensus - which I believe to be a legacy of the cold war, no longer serves their cultural or economic interests.<p>This process is naturally fractious, chaotic, sometimes violent, and full of dirty tricks, because politics isn&#x27;t just about flavor of the month policies anymore.

As a result, we&#x27;re running across real, fundamentally irreconcilable political and moral differences that have been buried for decades, as well as confronting the failures and controversies of our past.<p>Many of those fundamental agreements settle neatly along class, racial, and professional boundaries. Others, not so much.<p>Science denial and anti-intellectualism is the natural result, because much of science communication has become a carrier mechanism for policy prescriptions predicated upon society operating under a specific ideological consensus, when in fact someone of a different political persuasion might objectively consume the scientific data and come to a different policy conclusion based on the same data.<p>For the less educated, who encounter proposals from scientists they consider to be politically unworkable, and which might rightfully be considered manipulatively framed, it is easier to reject entire specialized fields of research out of hand than to investigate further and attempt to conceive of alternative proposals because they lack the tools to engage with the information effectively to begin with.<p>All of this is messy, but it constotutes a real political dialogue on the part of society.",1590524830,comment,-0.8306,0.073

8652,clarry,23316016,"&gt; How did it happen<p>It just did.  Halfway through my usual route, I started to notice a light ache around the knee.  Initially I didn&#x27;t think much of it, I figured it&#x27;s just a little stronger than normal muscle soreness, nothing unusual for exercise.  But I did lighten my pace a bit (not that I was pushing hard to begin with).  About half a mile later I switched to walking because I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable.  I walked home OK and it wasn&#x27;t terribly painful at that point, took a shower, ate, relaxed a bit and by the late evening it had gotten much worse and I couldn&#x27;t really take a step with that leg.<p>The other knee was similar but different.  Started feeling light ache when I took steps.  It never got very bad but I stopped running.  What was bad, and painful, really painful, was pulling on the leg.  Like when you pull your pants off when changing clothes, or when helping a tight shoe off with the hand.  Apart from that, it was always an annoying ache when taking steps.  Rest and it goes away.  Walk to the grocery store and back, and the ache is back, and so is the pain when you take pants off.<p>&gt; and do you have any suggestions for avoiding it?<p>Not really.  Checking with a physiotherapist or some experienced running coach would probably be ideal, but I guess the alternative is to just.. not push as far as I did.  Give your body plenty of time to adapt, increase the load only in tiny increments over months, and immediately stop at first sign of pain?  But as you say, it&#x27;s hard to gauge.  I didn&#x27;t think I was pushing hard at all!  If anything, I felt like I was in great shape to run longer and faster than I did.<p>If you do a search for knee injuries &amp; strength training exercises, you&#x27;ll also find that there&#x27;s supposedly a lot you can and probably should do to improve muscle strength to stabilize the knee and let other parts of the body take up some load to reduce the likelihood of injury.",1590524950,comment,-0.7673,0.152

On the other hand we&#x27;ve had adoption of touch screens on handheld devices, it almost swooped the entire mobile market between 2007-2012 after iPhone&#x27;s introduction. But the same thing didn&#x27;t happen with Keyboard + Mouse input on a desktop computer. Infact, the market just exploded with new mechanical keyboard aficionados sometime around 2010, I still remember hanging out on geekhack a decade ago and now mechanical keyboards are everywhere.<p>Glasses based 3D sucks.

Active shutter glasses give some people headaches from the flickering. If I could get perscription lenses with polarization for my TV&#x27;s passive 3d, I might play with it...

This display looks interesting because the viewer doesn&#x27;t have to wear anything, but we&#x27;ll see.<p>Touchscreens on mobile works because it&#x27;s cheaper to build than a number pad, and way cheaper than a keyboard, it&#x27;s cheaper to extend the touch screen so they don&#x27;t use any real buttons on the front of most androids. The flexibility is helpful for text input.<p>A basic keyboard for a computer is $10 at retail because there is no size constraint making things expensive. Even a $10 keyboard has better user feedback than a touchscreen, but a computer sized touchscreen is going to cost more than $10. Plus, ergonomics.

A model that is 99% accurate is not good enough for most mundane business tasks because they will fail in ways that no human ever would. Additionally, when you consider how much it costs upfront to hire a team of engineers and data scientists, build a training dataset, develop the code, maintain it etc, it quickly becomes clear that except for the most costly processes internally there is no way that AI is going to be cheaper than hiring a bunch of people in India by the hour.  Not to mention that the people in India can be retrained to do something in hours that would take your super specialized team of engineers months to reproduce with code.<p>Let&#x27;s also not forget that most business processes are bespoke to each corporation. Finding a single process that can be successfully targeted across multiple companies is hard.

Each of these brands could make their products for cheaper and lower quality, and make more immediate profit, at the (much larger) long-term cost of destroying the brand, the customer goodwill, and the market advantage.

The emphasis on quality and reliability of content was the pitch for Quora, for example, and they did much better at that task than Facebook.

8967,arkades,23316335,"So, I work in healthcare - as a doc, and at various times, as an admin in healthcare centers as well as in health insurance. I don&#x27;t know how much of that experience relates to FB&#x27;s behavior, but I have some idea of what it&#x27;s like to work in a field and be either called a hero or a devil, depending on the day. I am neither.<p>Deep breath.<p>As an industry, we are often doing things that are perceived to be evil. I&#x27;ve noticed the following:<p>1. Some of that interpretation is just wrong. People from the outside tend to have a poor understanding of what we do (providers, centers, insurers) and draw conclusions based on highly imperfect information. This is compounded by the fact that journalists have a terrible comprehension of what we do and an incentive to dramatize and oversimplify it - resulting in people <i>reading</i> the news and walking away misinformed and wrongly feeling like they&#x27;re now educated on the topic. This happens a lot.<p>2. We sometimes do things, or want to do things, that have potential harms <i>and</i> potential benefits - e.g., in health insurance, I&#x27;d love to have had the ability to twist people&#x27;s arms into coming to get a flu shot. It would have been a huge net benefit to their health. It would have been a net reduction in our costs. It would have been great! If we&#x27;d had the ability to ignore patient autonomy and force it, or carrot-and-stick it, we probably would have. We would not have conceptualized it as &quot;ignoring patient preference,&quot; we would have conceptualized it as &quot;preventing a bunch of preventable hospitalizations and deaths and, for the elderly, permanent consequences of hospitalizations.&quot; And that would have been true! And would have allowed us to not think about the trade-off so much. It&#x27;s not lying to yourself: it&#x27;s looking at the grey, round-edged parts of a cost-benefit analysis and subjectively leaning it in your direction. My motivation there isn&#x27;t even about the money - the money just gets it on the radar as something my employer would be willing to prioritize.<p>3. Resource scarcity. I only have so many resources to allocate. One may benefit a patient X; another may benefit them 10X. If X benefits my organization and the 10x choice doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll probably choose X. By itself I&#x27;m not choosing to do harm - I&#x27;m choosing a win&#x2F;win. Enough decisions like that, in enough contexts, probably do give rise to net harm. But the choice isn&#x27;t to do harm.<p>4. Not every battle can be a &quot;will I burn my career over this?&quot; battle. If I&#x27;d ever been faced with a choice that I thought was harm &gt; benefit to patients, I would have burnt the house down over it. But I haven&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve been faced with lots of little grey questions with uncertain costs and uncertain benefits where there was, in fact, benefit, and usually not just to us but to the patients too. I imagine that&#x27;s where most organizations go awry: a thousand decisions like this, shaking out under the pervasive organizational need for profit. Like a million million particles of sand moved by the tide, settling out into an overall pattern due to gravity. I think the badness is generally an emergent pattern, not a single person choosing to do evil, or choosing themselves over causing harm to many. I&#x27;ve never been in that position, ever, so either my career is highly anomalous, or that&#x27;s just not how those choices present themselves in real life. I suspect it&#x27;s the latter.

9022,curryst,23316390,"One significant difference is the sharp decline in value per watch&#x2F;listen.  Your favorite songs in your music library probably have hundreds of listens; how many times have you seen your favorite movie?<p>No one signs up for Spotify to binge listen for a month and then unsubscribe.  In video, that&#x27;s not uncommon.  I heard of people who would wait for Game of Thrones to end the season, then buy a month of HBOGo and watch the whole thing, then unsubscribe.  Likewise for movies; if you&#x27;re okay not being up to date with the latest movies you could just buy a subscription for a month once or twice a year, watch the things you&#x27;ve missed and then unsubscribe.<p>I think that&#x27;s a big part of the reason movies don&#x27;t go in that direction.  Most of what you&#x27;re paying for in a movie is novelty: a novel plot, novel characters, novel setting, etc.  Music is effectively the opposite; you find something you like, and you listen to it all the time.  Their model works perfectly for a &quot;pay per view&quot; system.<p>As for the fragmentation, I suspect the amount of money that the rights owner gets to keep is higher on their own system.  I.e. Netflix gets a flat $X&#x2F;month&#x2F;user, which they have to split among all their publishers.  If you&#x27;re a large enough publisher the math on what Netflix will pay you versus the number of subscribers you can get yourself probably works out.<p>The only better, yet still tenable, model I can think of would be for Netflix to go to a model similar to cable.  I.e. you pay $10 to get access to Netflix&#x27;s library.  If you want to access Disney content on Netflix, you pay $8 for a Disney upgrade.  If you also want WB, you pay $6 for a WB upgrade (in addition to the Disney one).<p>It would likely be cheaper than paying for Netflix and a separate Disney+ (I have to believe the marginal cost for distributing a movie is lower if we centralized on Netflix than it is for them both to have their own CDNs, etc).  Publishers still get paid per-user, so they don&#x27;t have to worry how big their piece of the Netflix pie is. Users get a single interface to stream all of their favorite stuff.<p>Piracy is always going to be more prevalent for movies for two primary reasons:<p>1) Movies are ephemeral for most people.  You watch it, and you move on.  You don&#x27;t need something like Spotify to manage a massive library of content, you can download stuff and delete it. Keeping it involves a lot of storage<p>2) Music has a much larger convenience factor.  I&#x27;m fairly often doing something else (driving, working, exercising) and think &quot;dang, I want to listen to this thing I&#x27;ve never listened to before&quot;.  Movies are typically something I plan more.  I would like to see a particular movie, but not right this second.  I can wait a few hours or days for it to download, no biggie.  Discovery is the bigger issue with movies, and that&#x27;s already provided by third party sites like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB.",1590527178,comment,0.9183,0.035

Indeed, reading a voter’s guide is much better: there’s no recency bias (where you only remember the crimes reported in the past couple months), you get to hear both sides of the story after the investigation has died down, you can actually think about the issues instead of worrying about the politics.

9284,Barrin92,23316652,"&gt;A couple of months ago, I was a train wreck that ate too many cinnamon rolls and watched Netflix while laying in sweats on the couch. Yesterday, I ran 3 miles, did 40 minutes of yoga, meditated, ate steel cut oats with berries for breakfast, then turned on my favorite business podcast while I showered, all before work started.<p>This reminds me of this guy with the bookshelf in his garage that went viral on youtube years ago. I honestly don&#x27;t think gamifying your life and jumping on the hedonistic treatmill is a step up from eating cinnamon rolls at 3 am, just the flip side of the same coin. It Reminds me of Baudrillard in <i>America</i><p><i>&quot;The skateboarder with his Walkman, the intellectual working on his wordprocessor, the Bronx breakdancer whirling frantically in the Roxy, the jogger and the body-builder: everywhere, whether in regard to the body or the mental faculties, you find the same blank solitude, the same narcissistic refraction. This omnipresent cult of the body is extraordinary. It is the only object on which everyone is made to concentrate, not as a source of pleasure, but as an object of frantic concern, in the obsessive fear of failure or substandard performance, a sign and an anticipation of death, that death to which no one can any longer give a meaning, but which everyone knows has at all times to be prevented. The body is cherished in the perverse certainty of its uselessness, in the total certainty of its non-resurrection. Now, pleasure is an effect of the resurrection of the body, by which it exceeds that hormonal, vascular and dietetic equilibrium in which we seek to imprison it, that exorcism by fitness and hygiene. So the body has to be made to forget pleasure as present grace, to forget its possible metamorphosis into other forms of appearance and become dedicated to the Utopian preservation of a youth that is, in any case, already lost. For the body which doubts its own existence is already half-dead, and the current semi-yogic, semi-ecstatic cult of the body is a morbid preoccupation. The care taken of the body while it is alive prefigures the way it will be made up in the funeral home, where it will be given a smile that is really ‘into’ death.&quot;</i>",1590528751,comment,-0.6008,0.12

9316,pdonis,23316684,"<i>&gt; A more interesting question is why is abortion consistently used as a tribal issue in US politics.</i><p>I think a factor here is that the US pushes the boundaries of what it really takes to have a free country with a diverse population more than other countries do.<p>Other countries--or at least other developed countries--have a more homogeneous population than the US has, and also do not have the same tradition of skepticism about and distrust of government that the US has. Also other countries do not have quite the same Constitutional provision for the free exercise of religion that the US has.<p>A less homogeneous population means there is a wider range of traditions that people are brought up with. That creates a lack of common ground about a lot of things. For example, I&#x27;m not aware of any other developed country that has a significant population of young earth creationists.<p>A tradition of skepticism about and distrust of government means that people are less willing to accept a legal rule that conflicts with their personal convictions, and more willing to complain about it publicly (or indeed to take even more drastic action). Note that this applies to both sides of the abortion debate: to extreme pro-lifers who feel that any abortion at all is wrong, and to extreme pro-choicers who feel that any restriction on abortion at all is wrong. Current US law and jurisprudence is actually not close to either of those extremes, so both extremes have plenty of reason, in their view, to complain.<p>The Constitutional protection of free exercise of religion means that &quot;personal convictions&quot;, if they are backed by a religious tradition, carry a lot more weight. This is most obvious in the US on the anti-abortion side of the debate.<p><i>&gt; Does someone benefit from these divisions</i><p>I think someone taking political advantage of divisions within the population can happen in any country, but it might well be true that the US, for the reasons I described above, presents more opportunities for it to happen.",1590528884,comment,0.8826,0.05

In reality, there are problems on both sides (people posting bad content, and bad actors taking on good content).  What I expect from Google is a constantly improving process on making sure bad content is removed, and good content is not.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like Google&#x27;s process is getting better - if anything it&#x27;s just swinging back toward blocking content faster.  I feel like there have been a few swings, such as back in 2011 when any background music or movie clip might mute or block your video, even when it&#x27;s fair use, to a more open model a few years later, and now we&#x27;re swinging back.  What I would hope is that they improve over time.  And yes, many times I think that involves actual people looking at things, which is expensive in terms of people as well as having to deal with tough content (mental health of those moderators being really tricky, just look at FB).  But the amount of arbitrary and poorly worded emails about how you violated the TOS but won&#x27;t say how.

The US economy isn&#x27;t out of the storm yet. Bear Sterns fell in March 2008 and the US economy kept &quot;whistling past the graveyard&quot; until September before it fell off a cliff after the smoke had somewhat cleared. Let&#x27;s check back in 3-5 months. The only national institution in the US that didn&#x27;t take a perception hit so far is the Federal Reserve, but that&#x27;s because it threw $8+ trillion at the problem and made big promises early (too soon to tell if that massive injection will be problematic).<p>I see a national USA government who chose not to take a significant role in either helping the states (and never told the states that this would be the policy) or other nations (as we normally do during every natural disaster and health epidemic since WW2). I don&#x27;t think I am alone in that view.<p>S Korea and Italy (yes, <i>that</i> Italy) sent PPE to assist other countries early in the first wave while the US federal government was intercepting shipments which were legally purchased by (entities in) other countries and diverting them to a federal government stockpile (not the states where civilians needed them).<p>It&#x27;s worth looking at how well S Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore reacted to the outbreak. Their emergency health systems acted as if it didn&#x27;t matter if &quot;China lied&quot; or not and set up useful policies and procedures just in case the disease made it there.<p>China has started to donate the medical equipment (PPE, ventilators) they didn&#x27;t need to use after the first wave and they are sending medical staff around the world to assist other countries. The US is exporting some hastily-made ventilators, but it&#x27;s not yet clear if that will make a difference in the perceptions other nations have of our response.<p>I think the US has lost significant soft power as we failed to provide the worldwide leadership we have since we became a superpower and China stood up to fill in the vacuum for very low cost to them.",1590529146,comment,-0.5875,0.075

I might be entirely willing to agree that they are <i>not</i> vital, and even that a (post)industrial highly structured society may also be a bit of an issue, but pretending that every child will just be naturally curious about 1&#x2F;3+1&#x2F;3=2&#x2F;6 vs 1&#x2F;3+1&#x2F;3=2&#x2F;3 is, IMO, not ground in reality.<p>In the original article, the guide isn&#x27;t &quot;standing front of the art&quot;.

I would believe it&#x27;s the novice though they could have different classes for different levels, but you couldn&#x27;t really prepare someone from novice to master in the manner of a few classes.<p>I&#x27;ve had a subscription for about eight months now.<p>Most of the classes are at the same level that &quot;prosumer&quot; hardware is marketed at: advanced amateur or beginning professional.<p>For example: Daniel Negranu (a poker pro) has a very good class on poker. At no point does he explain how to play the game or what terms like &quot;on the button&quot; mean - that&#x27;s all assumed knowledge. The target user is a player who can play a solid game already and hold their own in tournaments, perhaps without actually winning the final table.<p>Thomas Keller&#x27;s (a famous chef) masterclass is similar: at no point does he explain what a shallot is or how to hold a chef&#x27;s knife (obscure, seldom-used hooked knives ARE explained if they come up), but he does go into a lot of precise detail about how to cook certain dishes and exactly how to identify the freshest produce or tell when the lamb shank you are braising is done.<p>&gt;I&#x27;d say a master is generally quite well above 90th percentile of people in their field.<p>The quality of instructors is truly amazing - easily the top 0.1% - most are world-famous masters of their art. Things like acting lessons from AAA celebrities, dancing lessons from the lead ballerina at one of the top companies in the world, music lessons from multi-platinum artists etc.<p>This sounds like a giant ad for masterclass.

If you look at it being productive in aggregate, in society as a whole, the reasoning doesn&#x27;t work anymore.<p>Now, you could make the argument that the author is unaware of the many thousands of times that outrage in its various forms -- like protests, or riots, or revolutions -- has led to significant changes; perhaps he is simply astoundingly ignorant of essentially all history, and thus doesn&#x27;t know that outrage can do things like, say, get America to leave the Vietnam war, or get a President to resign from office, to use two well-known examples.

Now, programs like Mathematica can do much harder, more complex integrals.<p>Professor Patrick Winston pointed out that most of the AI programs we were going to look at in his class (chess, natural language, 3D vision in block world, etc.) ended up, like integration, as simple code plus a database of facts.<p>Back then, there was general optimism about the future of AI. No one anticipated how slow progress would be while the capabilities of the hardware grew a million-fold.<p>The work referenced in the article is interesting. It appears to be another small step in advancing AI. It&#x27;s a small, but difficult, step like almost every other advance in AI, and I admire the work done by those working in this field.<p>The problems of solving simple differential equations and symbolic integration at the first year calculus level are not really advanced math. Humans solve these problems with a relatively small bag of tricks that transform a symbolic integral into a simpler form. A program can do the same thing with an even more detailed database of transforms that can be attempted at each point in the search tree until a simple solution is reached.<p>The article claims that the new program can solve difficult integrals. This is interesting because hard to solve integrals are often associated with real physical phenomena. See for example the triple integrals of W. F. van Peype which arose while he was studying magnetism in different materials. These, relatively, plain looking definite integrals stumped some of the world&#x27;s most famous mathematicians.

You posit two choices in the next sentence:<p>- the pirate book&#x2F;game&#x2F;music is unencumbered and easier to use on more devices<p>- the legal book&#x2F;game&#x2F;music is DRM-laden and requires proprietary devices or apps to use<p>But: if I buy a Kindle book, DRM or not, it is <i>very</i> easy for me to buy and it is <i>very</i> easy for me to use on any device that runs the Kindle app. Buy it one device and it&#x27;s in the library on all of them; at worst I have to just tap to download it.<p>This is the way most companies have effectively competed with piracy: make it <i>more</i> convenient to get something legally. I&#x27;ve gone the whole &quot;set up automated scripts to scan piraate sites and wait for specific videos of a certain quality to show up, download them via torrent, tag them with proper metadata, convert them and  put them in my iTunes library&quot; route. It was clever and cheap and just super, super fragile and finicky. Pirate sites go up and down, metadata is wrong, something somewhere in the chain breaks mysteriously. You know what was more convenient? Clicking &quot;Season Pass&quot; in iTunes. Boom. Done. Convenience is also the proposition of streaming video and music, in a very real sense: it&#x27;s all technically DRM-encumbered, but your Spotify music is available on every device that supports Spotify with almost no effort on your part beyond logging the device in. If you have a strong enough philosophical objection to DRM that you find Spotify, Netflix, et. al, unpalatable, that&#x27;s great, but while it&#x27;s pretty easy to move DRM-free music files around it&#x27;s not as easy as just streaming -- and DRM-free video files are still kind of a pain in the butt compared to streaming, or even any centralized library system like Amazon or iTunes. The same is basically true for books: I <i>appreciate</i> Calibre, but &quot;It&#x27;s so easy to manage your ebooks and reading devices through Calibre compared to using the native Amazon Kindle or Apple Books apps&quot; is not a sentence most people are ever going to utter with a straight face.",1590530092,comment,0.9916,0.041

Even after accounting for possible unpublished failed studies, the analysis concluded that it is extremely unlikely that the effect doesn&#x27;t exist.[34]<p>&gt; In 2015, a meta analysis of over 100 studies by Carter and McCullough argued that the 2010 meta-analysis failed to take publication bias into account. They showed statistical evidence for publication bias. When they statistically controlled for publication bias, the effect size estimate was small (d = .2) and not significantly different from zero.[35][36] Michael Inzlicht and colleagues praised Carter&#x27;s meta analysis, but argued that bias-correction techniques are not precise enough to give a precise control size estimate.[5][37] In response, Cunningham and Baumeister argued that Carter and McCullough analysis contained errors in its data collection and in the various analyses used.[5]<p>&gt; Ulrich Schimmack (2016) conducted a meta-analysis of published studies and found that most studies could produce significant results only with the help of random sampling error. Based on the low power of studies, one would expect a large number of non-significant results, but these results are missing from published articles. This finding confirms Carter and McCullough&#x27;s meta-analysis that showed publication bias with a different statistical method. Schimmack&#x27;s replicability report also identified a small set of studies with adequate power that provided evidence for ego-depletion.

To be fair, there are also some advantages of using Pi-hole® over NextDNS:<p>1) You know who runs it. We can’t ask you to trust us more than yourself. We can provide all the guarantees you want, show who we are and make promises, it is understandably easier to trust a solution you manage yourself. Keep in mind though, that all your unblocked DNS queries are still visible by your upstream DNS. So there is still someone you need to trust with your data.<p>2) It’s free with no limits. NextDNS is cheap, very cheap, but it’s still a paid service if you use it over a certain limit. Pi-hole® is free to use. You still have to pay about $35 for a Raspberry Pi + an SD card, which is equivalent to several years of NextDNS subscription. You should also consider donating to the Pi-hole® project if you use their solution. After a few years though, yes, Pi-hole® should become less expensive than NextDNS.

The mon­keys were inject­ed with every­thing from human can­cer tis­sues to rare virus­es and even sheep­’s blood in an effort to find a trans­mis­si­ble can­cer.

10131,pwdisswordfish2,23317503,"&quot;Excuse my ignorance, but isn&#x27;t the overlay network setup problem one that has problems at almost every level of the stack?&quot;<p>It works for me and has worked for others.  The keyword here that distinguishes this idea from almost every other &quot;peer-to-peer overlay network&quot; project that you can read about is &quot;small&quot;.  If you limit the size of the network, you can avoid some problems.  Most projects you read about aim at the ability to create a single, large network that potentially everyone can join.  Open to the public.  However using a different approach it is possible to create only small networks that are only open to people you know, e.g., friends, family, co-workers.  There are still problems, but there are always going to be some problems.  The internet you are using right now has problems.  The question is does it work well enough.  The small overlay network idea has worked well enough for me that I consider it one of the better ones.
It is really impossible to debate these ideas on the internet.  Opinions are strong and negativity is even stronger.  If you want an answer you need to try things out yourself and draw your own conslusions.  No peer-to-peer solution is &quot;perfect&quot; and if you are always looking for the solution with zero negatives and zero limitations, you will never find it.  Worse is if you never actually try these solutions, you just read about them.  After you try many of them and learn what you like and do not like about the design&#x2F;implementation, it is easier to chose one idea that works for your use case.  Everytime someone starts promoting a peer-to-peer project you can quickly evaluate it, based on what types of designs&#x2F;implementations have worked for you and which ones didn&#x27;t.  Well, that&#x27;s my opinion, anyway.",1590534414,comment,0.9395,0.105

It makes more sense that that&#x27;s a pain - for what it&#x27;s worth, in my non-web content authoring I do a lot of embedding LaTeX in markdown and it can become a bit of a mess.<p>The boundary between a &#x27;headless cms&#x27; and a &#x27;static site generator&#x27; can get somewhat fuzzy. The approach that I <i>usually</i> take here, when it&#x27;s less of a hobby project, is to use a full-featured-editor-included CMS and then aggressively cache the pages so that behavior is just delivery of static files in the 99% case. This is an extremely common pattern with WordPress, for example---I would never call WordPress a paragon of performance but it is quite fast with the commonly used caching plugin that essentially reverts it to a static site generator for common cases. It&#x27;s even better to do the caching in a web server or other in-between layer which is generally going to be faster at shuffling files than whatever language your CMS is in.<p>When it comes to simpler options with TS, I would just write what you need in bare TS. That gets you the advantage of typing without the weight of a framework. It does make it more difficult (though of course not impossible) to rely on framework components but I don&#x27;t feel that really need them in your use-case.<p>Finally, totally with you on relying on the file system as a CMS. In my case I actually use the file name verbatim as the post title, one of those things that seemed too simple to work up front but is actually basically fine. The only constraint is that &quot;titles&quot; (e.g. file names) must start with the date because I just sort them to order posts - this is all so that posts can just be plaintext files (or markdown files, but I stick to plaintext as a stylistic decision) without needing to be parsed for any kind of header metadata or something. It is a limitation but I&#x27;m pretty happy with it a self-imposed one.<p>I also, to be fair, have a bit of a negative gut reaction to React in this kind of situation. In my line of works (operations or, to be more fashionable, DevOps), I have had more encounters than I can easily count with &quot;react apps that should be static files&quot; and are significantly more complex to deploy and maintain than they ought to be as a result. There&#x27;s nothing like fighting with the TypeScript compiler in the build chain for, well, a static file. I&#x27;d be less harsh on this if I hadn&#x27;t also experienced so many cases of developers shrugging when it ends up doing something undesirable, because they don&#x27;t even understand the React part of it all well.<p>I&#x27;m not really convinced that it can deliver faster development but I&#x27;m also not <i>un</i>convinced. I am pretty convinced that it ends up adding significant complexity that can really bite you when you encounter what ought to be trivial problems, and there&#x27;s such a large push towards &quot;batteries included&quot; frameworks in JS, combined with the very fast turnover in popular frameworks, that it seems excessively common for developers to be building on top of a framework that they don&#x27;t really understand well (because they just learned it and it does a lot under the hood) and that just has rough edges to deal with (because it&#x27;s relatively new). It&#x27;s enough to make you a little bitter after growing up on Python and, of all things, PHP, where frameworks and libraries tend to stick around for a long time, most developers have longer background with the language and framework, and the build-test-deploy toolchains are generally simpler. Not necessarily easier to use, but simpler---these two do not necessarily come along with each other, see &#x27;create-react-app&#x27; and its &#x27;eject&#x27;... a solution that is easy to use but so complex that it has a tendency to explode when you look askance at it.",1590535423,comment,0.9572,0.055

It still doesn&#x27;t work, gotta activate the Cloud Asset API (have you ever tried to use an AWS service and failed because the something something api wasn&#x27;t active yet? No you haven&#x27;t)

This very important security thing that you should do quarterly if not more often?
You click on trusted advisor, it shows you the unattached security groups you can safely delete, it advises the ones you should lock down. Done.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Google network infrastructure is  generations ahead of AWS.
But it&#x27;s all useless if you can&#x27;t get it working right and GCP documentation is worse than nothing at all.

10392,godelski,23317764,"I think one of the issues with this will be how it is linking the correct information. I like the little inclusion before tweets, but there&#x27;s no sources on them. Then when you scroll down on the tweets I see them in this order: The Hill, WaPo, CNN, a CBS News reporter, a Fortune Magazine reporter, a Vox reporter, Sr Political Reporter for Huffington, ACLU Nebraska, a CNN political correspondent.<p>The issue here is that everything here is considered in the hard left of the media. I&#x27;m concerned that this will only help grow the divide between Americans, though I also don&#x27;t have a better alternative to this. Clearly there is a lack of coverage of this from the right and in fact the opposite. A quick DDG search of &quot;fox news mail in ballot&quot; pulls up [0][1][2]. So when you see things like this I think it is easier to say that &quot;the left&quot; is trying to trick you. If Fox is your primary source of news, then it does look like Twitter is trying to silence a real issue. If Fox isn&#x27;t your primary source of news then it looks like Twitter is trying to fight misinformation. Things are so crazy that it really is hard to find the truth and there is very good reason to believe that someone is lying. And no one wants to admit that someone they&#x27;ve trusted for a long time is lying to them, especially when there&#x27;s nuggets of truth that you can hold onto.<p>So I&#x27;m a little worried about the repercussions of this, especially since the right already thinks Twitter is supporting the left.<p>Edit: By hard left I mean from the perspective of Fox viewers. My main point is about the perspective of the people this is specifically aimed at. While on the left we don&#x27;t see it that way go talk to your friends on the right, they see it differently. My concern is because we need to unify and not divide.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;voter-fraud-california-man-finds-dozens-of-ballots-stacked-outside-home"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;voter-fraud-california-man-...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;south-carolina-election-ballots-reportedly-found-in-maryland-this-week"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;south-carolina-election-bal...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;video.foxnews.com&#x2F;v&#x2F;6158607323001#sp=show-clips"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;video.foxnews.com&#x2F;v&#x2F;6158607323001#sp=show-clips</a>",1590536549,comment,0.9529,0.093
