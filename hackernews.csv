If somebody on the street comes up to you and says &quot;hey I&#x27;m going to come beat up your family.&quot; At a bare minimum, the cops are being called and it is somewhat taken seriously. On the internet though, it is a reality for many people (especially women) that there are no consequences for such horrible language and communication.

I don&#x27;t just go around swearing like in real life, but people are way more offensive on the internet.

So the benefit of running a meta-optimizer to solve a problem is difficult to realize versus a handmade neural network.

Sports, as you say, in particular are good here. I’ve been playing Echo Arena for a few weeks, now, and far from the novelty wearing off, I’m actually enjoying it more and more.

You&#x27;ve requested a page on a website (archive.md) that is on the Cloudflare network. Cloudflare is currently unable to resolve your requested domain (archive.md). There are two potential causes of this:<p>Most likely: if the owner just signed up for Cloudflare it can take a few minutes for the website&#x27;s information to be distributed to our global network.
Less likely: something is wrong with this site&#x27;s configuration. Usually this happens when accounts have been signed up with a partner organization (e.g., a hosting provider) and the provider&#x27;s DNS fails.

  - Why doesn&#x27;t it just drop and time out the request, so my computer decides to fall back to an alternate DNS resolver?

Couple that with the issue that a machine learning model is only one piece of an actual product improvement for these websites&#x2F;companies (ie: now you have a prediction, what are you gonna do with it to effect the product?), and all of the sudden you have actual incremental improvements completely misaligned with moonshot expectations.<p>We&#x27;ve had plenty of rankers and recommenders for decades, the current wave of deep learning variants are improvements, but they&#x27;re incremental from a high level.

Theirs could even be worse, if e.g. they accidentally push their second wave into winter and the weather effect turns out to be significant.<p>And that&#x27;s before considering the second-order cost in mortality.

The only difference is that we see coronavirus victims dying now, but the future deaths due to an under-resourced medical system will be lost in the noise.<p>None of this is to say that Sweden&#x27;s response is obviously right.

452,DiogenesKynikos,23315883,"Hang on a second there. We really have to go back to the history of Nortel, because the claim that Chinese hacking brought down Nortel really does not hold up.<p>Nortel expanded massively during the dot-com bubble, and went on a nearly $20 billion acquisition spree that caused it to lose money every quarter for years, even while its stock price was driven up by unrealistic expectations. Then the dot-com bubble burst, at which point these expectations were tempered and people began worrying about Nortel&#x27;s unprofitability. The stock crashed, raising capital became difficult, demand for Nortel&#x27;s products (and all telecommunications hardware) plummeted, and the company had to lay off 20% of its workers. At this time, Huawei was a tiny player outside of China. Nortel&#x27;s major competitor was Cisco.<p>In 2003, for the first time in years, Nortel finally posted a quarterly profit, but then came under investigation from the SEC over suspicions that it was fudging its numbers (specifically, the accusation was that executives shifted revenue in time in order to meet targets that earned them bonuses). The SEC charged top Nortel executives with fraud, and the case was eventually settled, but Nortel had to change out its top management. Nortel was also sued by shareholders, to whom it had to pay billions of dollars in a settlement. There were layoffs and downsizing throughout this entire period.<p>To look at that history, and then to claim that hacking that might have helped one of Nortel&#x27;s several competitors (and not even the largest, by a long shot) is the reason for Nortel&#x27;s demise just seems completely out of left field to me.

455,thephyber,23315886,"I&#x27;m not sure I agree that it&#x27;s the responsibility of the people doing research to protect against foreign nation state attacks (whether cyber or legacy intelligence).<p>1st: most people outside of government don&#x27;t know how much they are expected&#x2F;&quot;required&quot; to do to protect their work against foreign nation states. Except for heavily regulated sectors (government, military, heavy industry, banking, core telecom, and more recently elections) very few companies will actually get help from 3-letter-agencies to actively protect against foreign nation state attacks.<p>2nd: <i>many</i> people expect that the {NSA, Cyber Command, et al} are actively defending <i>all</i> US organizations. I don&#x27;t see evidence of this (although if there was evidence, I probably wouldn&#x27;t see it anyway).<p>3rd: In a national emergency (which the COVID response was declared), there are limits to the liabilities which would otherwise be enforceable in court. There are frequently&#x2F;always legal escape clauses like <i>force majeure</i> and <i>act of god</i> which would likely alleviate liabilities due to fallout from acts of war or a severe pandemic, so it&#x27;s not clear that those &quot;nasty liabilities&quot; could be enforced. There are currently 2 important cyberinsurance cases[1] which are winding their way through courts right now which may effectively decide if cyberinsurance is a viable product (depending on whether). Violations of HIPAA are possible, but similarly may not amount to much in terms of prosecution because of the pandemic.<p>In reality, it&#x27;s damn near impossible to protect against a motivated+targeted nation state attack (especially with the resources of PRC). If the liabilities incentives require all projects (large and small) be able to withstand nation-state attacks, then all of the project resources go to cybersecurity and none into research -- your productivity is now zero.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that it&#x27;s the FBI&#x27;s job to do counter-intel. If a medical research group is defrauded by PRC spies and you blame the researchers for not being able to spot a non-trivial espionage attempt, you are just victim blaming.

It&#x27;s based on a portable Motorola 6800 microprocessor, so the PDP-11 connection is unclear. A coaxial cable is placed up to the detonation point, and as the shock front progresses the cable is crushed, reflecting the TDR pulse back from that point. They call it &quot;Radar on a wire&quot;. The interval between pulses is between 20 and 90 microseconds, so this is much faster than the alleged PDP-11 network card.

552,astrophysician,23315983,"As a total outsider following this from a distance, I sort of feel for Facebook and other social media platforms facing this problem -- they&#x27;ve run up against a fundamental issue for which there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any satisfying solution. Misinformation and propaganda are rampant on their platforms definitely, and echo chambers that reinforce divisive worldviews have probably deepened real societal divisions, but how do you actually implement a policy to stop this? What is &quot;propaganda&quot;? What is &quot;misinformation&quot;? The entire core of Facebook&#x27;s existence is advertising, which means user engagement and reach is the only thing that drives your bottom line; they <i>want</i> to drive users to Facebook and keep them there, and keep them engaged. They&#x27;ve just happened to discover a universal human truth along the way, which is that people <i>like</i> feeling validated, and people <i>like</i> being a member of a tribe. Facebook is the way it is because thats what users <i>want</i>, whether they will admit to it or not.<p>Anything that Facebook does will be perceived as making a political and&#x2F;or moral statement, which they obviously are trying very hard not to do, because as soon as you take a position you alienate half of the population (at least in the US). They&#x27;ve apparently decided to go the route of burying their heads in the sand instead of <i>trying</i> to make things less tribal and divisive, which in all honesty is a pretty understandable position to take, and yet <i>even while actively trying not to piss off conservatives</i> they have still landed in hot water over perceived favoritism towards the left. They are damned if they do and damned if they don&#x27;t.<p>So honestly, what is the proposed solution here? What would you do if you were in Zuckerberg&#x27;s shoes? Do you campaign for regulations that take this issue off of your hands but that let the government call the shots somehow? Do you look at your board members with a straight face and tell them you&#x27;re going to tank user engagement for some higher, squishy moral purpose for which there is no clear payoff?",1590524675,comment,0.9868,0.05

566,crocodiletears,23315997,"They&#x27;re indicative of a collapse of consensus on the part of society. It could well be argued that prior to our current political era, especially in the US, that the political domain was largely constrained to a discourse on cultural aesthetics, wherein the Democrats and and Republicans argued over trivialities (on a broader national, not individual respect) such as abortion, marriage, and immigration, while they operated on an implicit consensus concerning foreign policy, and had a functional stalemate in terms of the size of the state, farming out many of their policy decisions to thinktanks, corporate donors, and well-established bureaucrats within our regulatory bodies<p>America&#x27;s role as international security guarantor, its trade policies, and its government&#x27;s role in domestic affairs was never really up for debate, and it only really changed stepwise in a stochastic manner, responding to situations and incentives day-by-day with no conscious consideration to the role of America or its state on a broader scale.<p>What we&#x27;re seeing now, is large portions of the population coming to realize that that existing bipartian components of the political consensus - which I believe to be a legacy of the cold war, no longer serves their cultural or economic interests.<p>This process is naturally fractious, chaotic, sometimes violent, and full of dirty tricks, because politics isn&#x27;t just about flavor of the month policies anymore.

As a result, we&#x27;re running across real, fundamentally irreconcilable political and moral differences that have been buried for decades, as well as confronting the failures and controversies of our past.<p>Many of those fundamental agreements settle neatly along class, racial, and professional boundaries. Others, not so much.<p>Science denial and anti-intellectualism is the natural result, because much of science communication has become a carrier mechanism for policy prescriptions predicated upon society operating under a specific ideological consensus, when in fact someone of a different political persuasion might objectively consume the scientific data and come to a different policy conclusion based on the same data.<p>For the less educated, who encounter proposals from scientists they consider to be politically unworkable, and which might rightfully be considered manipulatively framed, it is easier to reject entire specialized fields of research out of hand than to investigate further and attempt to conceive of alternative proposals because they lack the tools to engage with the information effectively to begin with.<p>All of this is messy, but it constotutes a real political dialogue on the part of society.",1590524830,comment,-0.8306,0.073

585,clarry,23316016,"&gt; How did it happen<p>It just did.  Halfway through my usual route, I started to notice a light ache around the knee.  Initially I didn&#x27;t think much of it, I figured it&#x27;s just a little stronger than normal muscle soreness, nothing unusual for exercise.  But I did lighten my pace a bit (not that I was pushing hard to begin with).  About half a mile later I switched to walking because I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable.  I walked home OK and it wasn&#x27;t terribly painful at that point, took a shower, ate, relaxed a bit and by the late evening it had gotten much worse and I couldn&#x27;t really take a step with that leg.<p>The other knee was similar but different.  Started feeling light ache when I took steps.  It never got very bad but I stopped running.  What was bad, and painful, really painful, was pulling on the leg.  Like when you pull your pants off when changing clothes, or when helping a tight shoe off with the hand.  Apart from that, it was always an annoying ache when taking steps.  Rest and it goes away.  Walk to the grocery store and back, and the ache is back, and so is the pain when you take pants off.<p>&gt; and do you have any suggestions for avoiding it?<p>Not really.  Checking with a physiotherapist or some experienced running coach would probably be ideal, but I guess the alternative is to just.. not push as far as I did.  Give your body plenty of time to adapt, increase the load only in tiny increments over months, and immediately stop at first sign of pain?  But as you say, it&#x27;s hard to gauge.  I didn&#x27;t think I was pushing hard at all!  If anything, I felt like I was in great shape to run longer and faster than I did.<p>If you do a search for knee injuries &amp; strength training exercises, you&#x27;ll also find that there&#x27;s supposedly a lot you can and probably should do to improve muscle strength to stabilize the knee and let other parts of the body take up some load to reduce the likelihood of injury.",1590524950,comment,-0.7673,0.152

On the other hand we&#x27;ve had adoption of touch screens on handheld devices, it almost swooped the entire mobile market between 2007-2012 after iPhone&#x27;s introduction. But the same thing didn&#x27;t happen with Keyboard + Mouse input on a desktop computer. Infact, the market just exploded with new mechanical keyboard aficionados sometime around 2010, I still remember hanging out on geekhack a decade ago and now mechanical keyboards are everywhere.<p>Glasses based 3D sucks. People who don&#x27;t wear glasses don&#x27;t want to wear glasses and find them unconfortable. People who do wear glasses don&#x27;t want to wear two pairs of glasses and find it uncomfortable. Active shutter glasses give some people headaches from the flickering. If I could get perscription lenses with polarization for my TV&#x27;s passive 3d, I might play with it... But I watched like one 3d blu-ray with the glasses and that&#x27;s good enough for me. This display looks interesting because the viewer doesn&#x27;t have to wear anything, but we&#x27;ll see.<p>Touchscreens on mobile works because it&#x27;s cheaper to build than a number pad, and way cheaper than a keyboard, it&#x27;s cheaper to extend the touch screen so they don&#x27;t use any real buttons on the front of most androids. The flexibility is helpful for text input.<p>A basic keyboard for a computer is $10 at retail because there is no size constraint making things expensive. Even a $10 keyboard has better user feedback than a touchscreen, but a computer sized touchscreen is going to cost more than $10. Plus, ergonomics.

Advanced concurrency possible via STM.</i><p>Most of the other design considerations sound like a description of Clojure:<p><i>- Plain and simple syntax, minimal boilerplate, few keywords, no need for OOP constructs. The code must be very easy to read through.</i> (this one is subjective I suppose. :-))<p><i>- Everything is an expression, no statements. The program itself is just a single expression.</i><p><i>- First-class functions and modules. Modules are simply sets of functions and records. Modules can be further organized into packages.

The emphasis on quality and reliability of content was the pitch for Quora, for example, and they did much better at that task than Facebook.

So many people have this knee jerk reaction of Chromium = Chrome = Google having total control. But don&#x27;t understand the only reason Google has had this much control over Chromium is because no other major vendor used it. They were the biggest kid on the street. But now that MS moved in a few doors down, that&#x27;s no longer true. Google has to acknowledge MS in a way they never did with Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, etc.. And the same thing would happen if FF switched to Chromium.<p>Idk about you, but having 3 of the 4 biggest vendors all being forced to collaborate and implement solutions supported by at least 1 of the others, is 1000000x better than having each do their own thing.

899,arkades,23316335,"So, I work in healthcare - as a doc, and at various times, as an admin in healthcare centers as well as in health insurance. I don&#x27;t know how much of that experience relates to FB&#x27;s behavior, but I have some idea of what it&#x27;s like to work in a field and be either called a hero or a devil, depending on the day. I am neither.<p>Deep breath.<p>As an industry, we are often doing things that are perceived to be evil. I&#x27;ve noticed the following:<p>1. Some of that interpretation is just wrong. People from the outside tend to have a poor understanding of what we do (providers, centers, insurers) and draw conclusions based on highly imperfect information. This is compounded by the fact that journalists have a terrible comprehension of what we do and an incentive to dramatize and oversimplify it - resulting in people <i>reading</i> the news and walking away misinformed and wrongly feeling like they&#x27;re now educated on the topic. This happens a lot.<p>2. We sometimes do things, or want to do things, that have potential harms <i>and</i> potential benefits - e.g., in health insurance, I&#x27;d love to have had the ability to twist people&#x27;s arms into coming to get a flu shot. It would have been a huge net benefit to their health. It would have been a net reduction in our costs. It would have been great! If we&#x27;d had the ability to ignore patient autonomy and force it, or carrot-and-stick it, we probably would have. We would not have conceptualized it as &quot;ignoring patient preference,&quot; we would have conceptualized it as &quot;preventing a bunch of preventable hospitalizations and deaths and, for the elderly, permanent consequences of hospitalizations.&quot; And that would have been true! And would have allowed us to not think about the trade-off so much. It&#x27;s not lying to yourself: it&#x27;s looking at the grey, round-edged parts of a cost-benefit analysis and subjectively leaning it in your direction. My motivation there isn&#x27;t even about the money - the money just gets it on the radar as something my employer would be willing to prioritize.<p>3. Resource scarcity. I only have so many resources to allocate. One may benefit a patient X; another may benefit them 10X. If X benefits my organization and the 10x choice doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll probably choose X. By itself I&#x27;m not choosing to do harm - I&#x27;m choosing a win&#x2F;win. Enough decisions like that, in enough contexts, probably do give rise to net harm. But the choice isn&#x27;t to do harm.<p>4. Not every battle can be a &quot;will I burn my career over this?&quot; battle. If I&#x27;d ever been faced with a choice that I thought was harm &gt; benefit to patients, I would have burnt the house down over it. But I haven&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve been faced with lots of little grey questions with uncertain costs and uncertain benefits where there was, in fact, benefit, and usually not just to us but to the patients too. I imagine that&#x27;s where most organizations go awry: a thousand decisions like this, shaking out under the pervasive organizational need for profit. Like a million million particles of sand moved by the tide, settling out into an overall pattern due to gravity. I think the badness is generally an emergent pattern, not a single person choosing to do evil, or choosing themselves over causing harm to many. I&#x27;ve never been in that position, ever, so either my career is highly anomalous, or that&#x27;s just not how those choices present themselves in real life. I suspect it&#x27;s the latter.

934,kerkeslager,23316370,"&gt; I’m not sure how you expect to have a productive conversation when, in this and parallel comments, you’ve made several insinuations that I’m a conscienceless lizard person.<p>Your reaction that perhaps corporations shouldn&#x27;t apologize when they do something wrong if it have any selfish benefit, does lack conscience and is a wholly inappropriate reaction to this situation. Discussing the self-centered strategic merits of apologizing from the perspective of a sociopath isn&#x27;t a productive conversation.<p>However, I&#x27;m not one to write people off based on one interaction. Just because you&#x27;ve reacted without conscience in one situation doesn&#x27;t mean you would do so in all situations.<p>&gt; But to be clear: Triplebyte’s specific situation is a an ethical issue only in respect to the fact that they planned to enable by default for existing users. That’s a bad move. They’ve stopped the bad move.<p>There are more ethical issues than that--they haven&#x27;t stopped them all.<p>&gt; I’m more interested in the overall pattern of “company does thing, people disagree with thing, people express outrage to company, company issues statement”. Which in many cases has zero ethical components.<p>Which is irrelevant in this case, because this case does have multiple ethical components.<p>And, more to the point, this is still an ethical question. Apologies are <i>never</i> about benefiting the person apologizing. Apologies are inherently an ethical action--if you claim that the company didn&#x27;t do anything wrong, then they shouldn&#x27;t apologize. Not because it doesn&#x27;t benefit them, but because lying about being sorry isn&#x27;t ethical.<p>&quot;Should a company lie and pretend to be sorry when they haven&#x27;t done anything wrong?&quot; is <i>still</i> an ethical question, and you&#x27;re looking at it from the perspective of selfish gain is <i>still</i> an inappropriate way to look at it.",1590527023,comment,0.9442,0.138

954,curryst,23316390,"One significant difference is the sharp decline in value per watch&#x2F;listen.  Your favorite songs in your music library probably have hundreds of listens; how many times have you seen your favorite movie?<p>No one signs up for Spotify to binge listen for a month and then unsubscribe.  In video, that&#x27;s not uncommon.  I heard of people who would wait for Game of Thrones to end the season, then buy a month of HBOGo and watch the whole thing, then unsubscribe.  Likewise for movies; if you&#x27;re okay not being up to date with the latest movies you could just buy a subscription for a month once or twice a year, watch the things you&#x27;ve missed and then unsubscribe.<p>I think that&#x27;s a big part of the reason movies don&#x27;t go in that direction.  Most of what you&#x27;re paying for in a movie is novelty: a novel plot, novel characters, novel setting, etc.  Music is effectively the opposite; you find something you like, and you listen to it all the time.  Their model works perfectly for a &quot;pay per view&quot; system.<p>As for the fragmentation, I suspect the amount of money that the rights owner gets to keep is higher on their own system.  I.e. Netflix gets a flat $X&#x2F;month&#x2F;user, which they have to split among all their publishers.  If you&#x27;re a large enough publisher the math on what Netflix will pay you versus the number of subscribers you can get yourself probably works out.<p>The only better, yet still tenable, model I can think of would be for Netflix to go to a model similar to cable.  I.e. you pay $10 to get access to Netflix&#x27;s library.  If you want to access Disney content on Netflix, you pay $8 for a Disney upgrade.  If you also want WB, you pay $6 for a WB upgrade (in addition to the Disney one).<p>It would likely be cheaper than paying for Netflix and a separate Disney+ (I have to believe the marginal cost for distributing a movie is lower if we centralized on Netflix than it is for them both to have their own CDNs, etc).  Publishers still get paid per-user, so they don&#x27;t have to worry how big their piece of the Netflix pie is. Users get a single interface to stream all of their favorite stuff.<p>Piracy is always going to be more prevalent for movies for two primary reasons:<p>1) Movies are ephemeral for most people.  You watch it, and you move on.  You don&#x27;t need something like Spotify to manage a massive library of content, you can download stuff and delete it. Keeping it involves a lot of storage<p>2) Music has a much larger convenience factor.  I&#x27;m fairly often doing something else (driving, working, exercising) and think &quot;dang, I want to listen to this thing I&#x27;ve never listened to before&quot;.  Movies are typically something I plan more.  I would like to see a particular movie, but not right this second.  I can wait a few hours or days for it to download, no biggie.  Discovery is the bigger issue with movies, and that&#x27;s already provided by third party sites like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB.",1590527178,comment,0.9183,0.035

Indeed, reading a voter’s guide is much better: there’s no recency bias (where you only remember the crimes reported in the past couple months), you get to hear both sides of the story after the investigation has died down, you can actually think about the issues instead of worrying about the politics.

These changes made a pretty noticeable improvement to our finances and we&#x27;re now getting ready to move into a house where I&#x27;ll have a dedicated office for work instead of a corner of the basement, and that&#x27;s going to have some nice tax impacts too.<p>My employer has done a really good job embracing remote.  There was a time when they actually retracted all ability to work remotely and had everyone move to work at our main office or look for another job.  A shift in regime happened, and remote eventually came back, and now we&#x27;ve got a whole pile of benefits specifically for our remote employees, to help counterbalance the fact that they don&#x27;t get some of the benefits that our in-office employees get.<p>One thing that we all get is a stipend we&#x27;re allowed to use generally on things that help improve our lives or help us grow as people (a few examples of expensible things would be a new mattress, cooking classes, voluntarily chosen equipment for our workspace, etc).  So we really already had the ability to expense the things we need for WFH, which has definitely been a big help.<p>As far as Overwatch between PRs...  I mean, let&#x27;s be real.  Think about how much time you spend in the office chatting with coworkers about weekend plans, or what was on TV last night, or any other thing.  Or, for those of you that have something like it, playing pool or ping pong.  This is just an evolution of that.

What counts as standard of living or quality of life varies according to the individual.<p>For example, the bay area has excellent weather, a ton of ethnic&#x2F;cultural diversity, very solid restaurant scene, lots of interesting nature nearby to explore, the area around SF has passable public transit, some bits have decent biking&#x2F;walkability, and there&#x27;s excellent options for international travel.

If you settle down in the bay area, yeah the housing situation is awful, but you don&#x27;t have to worry too much about your particular company going under or treating you like garbage one day, because there are a ton of other tech companies you could switch to.<p>If you move to a random non-techie city where your current employer is the only employer of note, then that means settling down there puts you in an awkward situation: you&#x27;re now tied down to them.

1228,clarry,23300233,"&gt; What is the middle ground that permits SOME computation in the client<p>You already went down the wrong road there.  Can you imagine how to add functionality declaratively?<p>The middle ground is extending user agents to support features that improve the browsing experience and enable new functionality, without turning it into an arbitrary application delivery framework.  And yes, this means rejecting and scoping out some things that people do in browsers today.<p>Just like in the past, you as a developer would get to choose whether to write a website (ubiquitous, accessible, runs on grandma&#x27;s old potato, relatively easy and cheap to maintain; these are the things that made the web popular and businesses around the world decided that it&#x27;s ok to to make their product a website even if that meant they couldn&#x27;t have all the features you could with a desktop application), a native application (more effort, more complex, more expensive, more invasive, more friction, more concerning w.r.t. security), or both.<p>To illuminate you, let&#x27;s pick some examples from the false-dichotomy post...<p>Consider form validation.  In fact, this is already done (and could always be extended to support more cases).  HTML5 has built-in form validation that works <i>without</i> javascript.  And of course it&#x27;s still perfectly backwards compatible with old browsers that don&#x27;t do validation; they might send you invalid fields, but you will have to validate them server side anyway because you can&#x27;t trust the client.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Learn&#x2F;Forms&#x2F;Form_validation"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Learn&#x2F;Forms&#x2F;Form_va...</a><p>Static maps have already been done.  Not a super smooth experience, but you could always improve that by speccing a zoomable &amp; pannable tiled image element that&#x27;ll send requests to the specified URL when you pan outside of the loaded area or zoom in.  Add a set of loadable elements that are embedded into this image element and you get something that starts to resemble SVG.  No JS required.<p>Information about points of interest could already be shown with the hover selector, but there&#x27;s no reason we couldn&#x27;t spec an element whose visibility can be toggled with a click, no js needed.<p>Upvote&#x2F;downvote buttons just need an attribute that tells the browser to post the request but stay on the current page.  (This also degrades trivially with browsers that don&#x27;t support the attribute) You could even toggle the visibility of the arrows after posting; similar CSS selectors for checked inputs already exist.<p>In general, there&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t have post or get requests that display the response in a new element without reloading the entire page.  Semantically, not very different from target=&quot;_blank&quot; or whatever you use to load something in a new tab &#x2F; windows, except this time you want the target to be an element.<p>(At this point I&#x27;d also like to note that frames exist and yes they suck but hilariously a lot of the new web does exactly the kind of stateful non-linkable things that framesets were derided for; only worse, because you actually <i>could</i> right-click a frame and link directly to it, but you can&#x27;t right-click and link the arbitrary DOM that was cooked by your client-side javascript)<p>Going with the tiled image element theme, there&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t have more elements that instruct the browser how to load more data on demand.  These same elements could let the <i>user agent</i> decide whether to paginate or scroll infinitely, or how many items to display per page.<p>(There&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t load images progressively and on demand.. progressive JPEG exists already, but for some reason devs still insist on giving me a blur and nothing more will load unless I enable scripts)<p>The way we currently do things really sucks for the user (because they have very little control over how the script behaves; the user agent is degraded to a mere dumb client with little meaningful configurability) and it sucks for developers who would rather just focus on the content and let the browser provide whatever UX fits the user &amp; their platform best.<p>Web devs are in a hurry to paper over the deficiencies of browsers but in doing so (and not fixing browsers), we end up with something worse and every goddamn website becomes a complex application.  We&#x27;re stuck in a worst-of-both-worlds state, where the browser runs applications that lack the power of desktop applications, yet are invasive, heavyweight -- don&#x27;t run on grandmas old potato, complex &amp; expensive to develop and maintain (every website shipping complex UI logic that should be part of the browser instead), increasingly less accessible and less reliable, less linkable &amp; crawlable, less secure.. it&#x27;s all I never wanted.",1590408973,comment,-0.9628,0.085

Anyway, in my google calendars I show both the IST and my  local timezone so that while setting meeting we can easily tell people at the extremes what the time is.  I also use the worldtimebuddy website (and Klok app on iOS) to show all the timezones so I can tell people the times when I am setting a meeting time.  This way no one has to do the math.  It takes 2 seconds to glance at the website or app and see everyones timezones and write it down or say it on a call.<p>What would be better is if we could add more than 2 timezones to google calendar, then it&#x27;d be easier.  But still not hard.  My rule is the place that has the bulk of the people is who gets the most favorable time for the meeting.  That way if 4 people are in one TZ and one person in another, we inconvenience the one person, if anyone has to be, not the 4.

The current systems, specifically Google’s, produce a sequence of numbers.

So, the current state of the art, Noisy Intermediate State Quantum computers are not useful for any computation and we need to get to 1000+ qbits to achieve the supremacy.

The language gives you what you need for performances, you do not need to play with that.<p>I said be aware of, not touch. If you weren&#x27;t doing things like memory alignment pragmas then I guess your performance requirements were never so stringent. Fact is that a Java program that&#x27;s fitting its data into L2 or avoiding cache line aliasing will blow a C++ program that isn&#x27;t out of the water.<p>&gt; Theory is what you say. Practice is that 98% of performance critical software in HPC, game industry, physics and High Frequency Trading is in C++&#x2F;C (maybe Rust soon). And this is why.<p>HPC&#x2F;physics follow questionable development practices in a lot of areas, and the games industry follows questionable everything practices.

1424,simias,23300429,"&gt;Wow. To equate logic errors with being clueless?<p>I meant that input sanitization is generally an easier problem to solve than writing safe C. If you can&#x27;t do the former reliably, I&#x27;m certain you wouldn&#x27;t be able to do the latter.<p>Input sanitization should generally be handled very close to the interface, once you went through this step you should expect to only deal with safe data. Memory safety covers the entire application, if some non-critical debugging function 10 level deep in the call stack messes up when it computes the size of a message buffer you can have a remote code execution vulnerability.<p>&gt;Also you assert it is absurd to compare WordPress and openssh In the context of this argument why? They are both widely used software with very high stakes on their reliability and security.<p>Wordpress is a complicated ecosystem with multiple plugins that each can introduce security problems. Its attack surface is also incredibly large since it&#x27;s generally public facing and anybody can interact with a lot of the features by default. That coupled with the fact that it&#x27;s extremely popular make it a very good target for attackers. It&#x27;s also a relatively fast moving target since the web changes fairly fast and new features have to be implemented regularly.<p>OpenSSH does mostly one thing and does it well. Its surface of attack is a lot smaller and it&#x27;s vastly easier to audit and test. Its development is also overseen by the OpenBSD developers, who are famously uncompromising regarding safety. The feature set is very stable and changes very slowly.<p>&gt;Actually it shows memory management is a don&#x27;t care variable.<p>The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. How much development effort went into making sure that these issues didn&#x27;t exist? How many thousands of hours auditing the code and making sure it did what people wanted? In a safer language this time could&#x27;ve been spent auditing other parts of the codebase or implementing other features.<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out that one of the biggest OpenSSH vulnerabilities ever found (in the Debian version of OpenSSH where the maintainer heavily reduced the generated key entropy by mistake) was indirectly caused by a memory issue since the reason for the patch was a false-positive returned by Valgrind regarding use of uninitialized memory.",1590411036,comment,0.9668,0.058

1499,mrjin,23300504,"I&#x27;ve read through the article and it turns out to me that he wrote it to show he was lucky enough not to experience a multi-disk RAID failure. Personally I owned dozens of HDDs across almost all brands from desktop&#x2F;laptop HDDS to Enterprise HDDs or NAS HDDs and almost half of them had bad sectors with a life span of a couple of months to a few years, some of which even broke in a row in a few days. The only exception is that in my last batch of 5 Seagate NAS drives, there was no single failure after around 4 years and I think I&#x27;m just been lucky with those as I did hear quite a few people were complaining about the same model.<p>Due to the nature of how HDD works, the surfaces of the disks have more or less defects leaving the factory and were graded by the count of defects, and even the enterprise grade one are not free of defects. Those defects and adjacent areas then are masked by the firmware so that magnetic heads won&#x27;t trying to read&#x2F;write to&#x2F;from them. But that won&#x27;t prevent them from growing. The factories are very clean but the dusts in the air are simply impossible to avoid and if one lands on the disk, it&#x27;s a time bomb. Also as the disks&#x27; capacity grows, the tracks get narrower and narrower. The disks spins from 5400 rpm to 15000 rpm maybe even faster and the magnetic heads are gliding micros from the disk and if the heads touch the disk surface, it almost for sure to create a bad sector event bad tracks. And again, the vibrations are impossible to avoid. Making it even worse, the contact are almost guaranteed to generate debris to be scattered to the whole disk, event goes to other disks sealed in the same case. The bigger capacity, the narrower the track will be, the less tolerant to such contact. Based on the fact, I really don&#x27;t see where he got the confidence the disks people bought were not going to have bad sectors during their expected life span.<p>Also the disks people use to build the RAID are most likely the same brand, the same model and the same batch and thus if one started to have bad sectors, most likely the others are going to have them soon or even worse may already have them. Even if the other disks in the array do not have bad sectors at the time of the failure, they are highly likely going to have during the rebuilding process, why? The load. Take a 10TB drive as an example, my Seagate 10 NAS drive can deliver ~180MB&#x2F;s peak writing and ~80MB&#x2F;s at the trough. Let&#x27;s assume it can deliver 100MB&#x2F;s all the way, and the disk is half full it will almost take 14 hours to finish, this load is highly likely to push other drives to the limit. For RAID6 allows another 1 to fail. For RAID5, if another drive failed during rebuilding, you data is gone. If you had to rebuild a 12 bays NAS, you would know how frustrating it could be, especially when there were secondary failures.<p>Software RAID may somehow alleviate the problem a little bit but it will also cover up the issue. My experience was that once there is one single bad sector, there will be lots of them soon, if you don&#x27;t back up the data and replace the faulty drive on spot, most likely it will be too late.<p>All above does not event consider the setup and quirks of NAS or RAID cards. Put all those issue aside, what&#x27;s are the benefits of RAID for home users? IMO, almost NIL. Our home network device most likely are Gigabyte ones with 1 Gbps ports, which can only deliver about 100MB&#x2F;s, you can see that a single drive can almost saturate that bandwidth even with link aggregation. And most people does not need the random IO boost or extra large volumes come with RAID.<p>My suggestion for home users is to go single drive and stay away from RAID.",1590411589,comment,-0.9939,0.108

Org mode is particularly special because it integrates so many of Emacs&#x27; features, from literate programming to keeping a Wiki, to scheduling, to keeping a diary, to file browsing, to accounting, to emailing, to so much more. But to try to judge one package like org mode is a bit like judging a car by the quality of its seats.<p>The only thing I&#x27;ve experienced which compares to this is, perversely, the Office 365 suite. Yes, of course, all the functions are completely different and I&#x27;m not making a like-for-like functionality comparison. But in Office365 an email client (Outlook) is integrated with a team&#x27;s documents (via Sharepoint), chats (via Teams), calendar, etc, etc. The value of Office365 isn&#x27;t in any one app, it&#x27;s their integration. It&#x27;s the entire system.<p>Obviously the Emacs system has a completely different and opposing design philosophy to Office365&#x27;s.

1825,nawwal,23300830,"Moscow is a great place to live&#x2F;base, but $800&#x2F;month for a comfortable middle-class life here is definitely an underestimate. I&#x27;m from the US - lived in NYC, Boston, and LA - and have been based in Moscow for the past year; it&#x27;s hard to overstate what an amazing city this is, though it&#x27;s important to note that there is a massive difference between Moscow (or St Petersburg) and the rest of Russia. I&#x27;ve traveled to many places within Russia and they might as well be different countries when compared to this mega-city. Speaking of Moscow specifically: it&#x27;s incredibly beautiful, it has the best metro system I&#x27;ve seen in the world (to the point that some metro stations are actually tourist spots), world-class international food, plenty of museums, shows, theaters, active nightlife, plus all the conveniences you&#x27;d find in the West. And of course there&#x27;s the comfort of a European feel to the city, with the excitement that comes with learning about the Russian&#x2F;Soviet culture and mindset of some people (esp. the older crowd, whereas the younger educated muscovites are basically European). Flights to the main European, US, and Asian cities are cheap and frequent: a roundtrip nonstop flight Moscow-NY is usually ~$300, London can be as cheap as $15 (yes, that&#x27;s fifteen dollars), and I&#x27;ve even booked a flight to Hong Kong the day before flying for like $200 direct. The people are super friendly, and although the majority do not speak English, it&#x27;s fairly easy to find English-speaking Russians or expats if you hang out in the center or know the spots (I have many expats friends who&#x27;ve been here for 2-3 years and don&#x27;t speak a word of Russian beyond saying &quot;thank you&quot;, yet manage to live very active social lives).<p>Having said all of this, however, I am also very aware that my experience here is very different from the average Russian. Being an expat, from the US, speaking English, and being able to afford a comfortable lifestyle in the center give me a much rosier perspective than if I were a low-income worker having to commute 1+ hours to get to work. I&#x27;m ethnically Latino and look obviously not-Russian, so people here are curious about me and act extra nice - especially when they find out I&#x27;m American. It&#x27;s not uncommon for someone to approach me on the street, a park, or a bar just because they heard me speaking in English. On the other hand, however, immigrants from ex-Soviet countries (particularly Central Asia) face discrimination and racism, as do non-European Russians (eg: Russians from the Caucasus region, or the east of Russia), and it&#x27;s not uncommon when looking to rent an apartment to see the words &quot;FOR SLAVS [white Russians] OR FOREIGNERS ONLY&quot;, something that would be completely illegal in the US. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, as an expat from the West I find Moscow to be just about the perfect place to live, but I totally understand the perspective of many Russians or some immigrants that criticize it harshly.

His interviews seem generally well-prepared. They don&#x27;t go particularly deep on any subject matter, but if you&#x27;re familiar with the subject matter they still prompt interesting responses from the guests - you can see someone like Carmack or Musk go into rubber-duck debugging mode trying to digest complicated thoughts into succinct answers and that has an interesting information side-channel to it (it tells you what they really think is important to say or highlight, and Rogan seems to be aware of this - he is good at getting the bits they <i>personally</i> find important).<p>- Related to the above, the macho&#x2F;masculinity slant aside he acts humble and un-obnoxious. I might feel differently if I watched any episode with a guest I really dislike (because he seems to be more accommodating than challenging&#x2F;critical, for sure), but in the episodes I watched I wasn&#x27;t annoyed with him.<p>- Part of his prep is also clearly to read up on recent&#x2F;controversial things related to a guest and probe for it during the interview, so there&#x27;s the shock value&#x2F;titilation factor that adds to the entertainment. His skill is that both him and the interviewee anticipate this but he still puts his subjects at ease enough in the moment to make the responses compelling. It has your brain constantly working to sort through what is guarded and what is not (=real), just like quality reality TV (everyone knows reality TV is scripted -- the entertainment is in trying to identify the sliver of authenticity in people&#x27;s emergent behavior on camera).",1590413326,comment,0.9808,0.034
